Jawa 42 Bobber,4.1,Nice Bike ,4,My experience on this one was the best in class and the smoothness I felt while driving was like butter on bread. The bike gives good speed in minimum time as it looks heavy but it is not. The concept of having a single seat on the bike is making the bike look more stylish. Bobber 42 overall was the nicest of all JAWA bikes. 
Jawa 42 Bobber,4.1,Amazing Bike,4,It's the bike you will fall in love with the moment you see it. Its performance is great styling is great but you will have to compromise with the mileage. But overall it's worth buying.

Jawa Perak,4.6,"India's first Stock bobber, sheer class.",4,"India just got its very first Bobber style motorcycle, The mighty Perak has the capability to steal hearts, the road attention it gets is incredible but when it comes to maintaining it we can't give any judgement because it is just launched in Jan and many of us have not got it due to pandemic, the wait time is very high but I am sure it will worth the wait."

Such a great riding experience, never had any problems in my 1000 KMS ride within a week. No vibrations and unnecessary noise even when riding at 100 KMPH. Engine heat is an issue when riding within the city. No issues during long rides. Exhaust sound: waiting for the company to advise on removing the DB Killer (as of now a strict no to this). I rode 200 KMS in a stretch and never had any back pain (I have issues with my L5). Only recommendation is to have some extra padding for the seats. Literally rules the road on a highway ride."

Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Bike performance is excellent,4,Bike's performance is excellent. The engine is powerful. Look and style is also good. But staff of Jawa showroom Dehradun is very uneducated behaving rudely with there customers don't have a manner how to talk with there customers.
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,ENGINE IS VERY NICE.,3,"The seat is not comfortable for a long journey and cushioning very less. The front mudguard is very less width.

Jawa Perak,4.6,Most attractive bike ever,4,"The look of the new Jawa Perak is quite attractive. It gets a floating single-seat standard with the integrated taillight. Round headlamps, single-seat, black wire-spoke wheels, bar-end mirrors, small fenders, and slash-cut exhaust give it the look of a classic bobber bike. The bike also has a rear seat option."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Superb Bike,5,This is a nice bike with good mileage. The riding experiance is also superb.
Jawa Perak,4.6,Will attract  those who value aesthetics,5,"The Perak is simply a modified version of the normal Jawa, but instead of the rear subframe, it has an interesting and striking cantilevered seat. The seat's tan colour contrasts wonderfully with the bike's matte black motif and gold pinstriping, and it is fastened to the main frame by a sturdy-looking sheet of metal. In the back of the seat is a stylish round LED brake, and behind that is a sizable fender with nothing but air above it."
Jawa Perak,4.6,Good Looking Bike,4,"A deeper examination of Jawa Perak reveals that the finish levels are actually a touch higher than the most recent Jawa models. On cold mornings, the speedometer still collects moisture, and because of its poorly chosen placement, the rider is unable to read the lower part of the gauge. Additionally, the rear indicators' exposed cables are tacky."
Jawa Perak,4.6,Overall Great Experience To Ride,4,It is a great bike in looks with good comfort and has a bit low mileage. Overall great experience to ride.

Jawa,4.3,Worst experience.,1,"I am owning Jawa for the past 1 month. The bike is good looking and the best performance. Everything looked good for the past one month. But now it started several problems. The bike stops suddenly while riding that too at 3 or 4 gear. I tried to start, but it stopped again and again. I had to push for more than 5 km. Next is the rusting problem. They said they will replace it too. Next is discomfort during riding. The seat is so stiff. Your backbone will be at risk if you drive for longer distances."
Jawa,4.3,Powerful bike.,5,This bike offers a great fuel economy and a powerful engine.
Jawa,4.3,Best in the segment.,4,The bike has single ABS on the bike that improves safety and the ride experience is also great with soothing exhaust sound.
Jawa,4.3,Amazing ride.,5,"It looks so lovely like a bobber bike & this bike's engine is great also, this bike is good in mileage. This bike's engine produces more power and torque than Royal Enfield. One of the best things about these bikes is its double exhaust."
Jawa,4.3,Ok not fully satisfied with the bike,3,Performance wise good but quality wise not that good overall the bike is ok not to the expectation

Jawa,4.3,Great Bike,4,It is the best bike with nice mileage but the seat is not much comfortable. Ground clearance is low but good for the city and a heavy good bike.
Jawa,4.3,Great Bike,4,It is well and good but tubeless may be matter but it is best in choice. I had purchased this bike for my brother.
Jawa,4.3,Great Bike ,4,Great bike with superb handling dual and ABS model. Ground clearance is low if you have the main stand otherwise ground clearance is decent. Braking is confident aspiring in dual ABS model. Performance is way better than re-classic 
Jawa,4.3,Jawa 300 Crome Is Awesome Bike,5,"The bike is awesome in all aspects. Its whether look, mileage, long drive, pickup, styling, performance, safety, and many more. (i.e- attractive, dual silencer, ground clearance, no height barrier, etc.)"
Jawa,4.3,A classic-looking bike ever,4,"Jawa 300 is the perfect bike for average-height people. If you are looking for a properly classic-looking bike, the Jawa is your best bet right now. This bike hits all the right nostalgic notes at first glance itself. The built quality and the riding comfort are a sheer pleasure in addition to the awe it gets fellow riders of other bike enthusiasts. "
Jawa,4.3,Comfortable Ergonomics,4,"When traveling a long distance, the functional design of the Jawa 300 is the most significant factor in determining the rider's comfort. Another advantage of the Jawa 300 is that it has a comfortable riding posture. The footpegs are set slightly forward, and the handlebar is quite high. So you sit quite upright, which is comfortable for most Indians."
Jawa,4.3,Jawa 300 - Best Touring Bike,4,"The Jawa 300 can be converted into a good touring bike. It also has a fuel level indicator, which most retro bikes lack. However, because the bike is new to the Indian market, the reliability factor is still unknown."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Easy Handling,4,"This bike has a long handle, sitting is comfortable, easy handling, smoothness even at higher acceleration, and the looks are stunning looks. "
Jawa,4.3,It has poor paint quality,3,"Jawa 300 ground clearance is not going to be a problem as per me but go slow when you are riding with a pillion. Its paint quality is not good, you can get scratches so easily, So you have to do lamination or ceramic coating as soon as you buy it. Its mileage is around 37 to 40 Kmpl for me."
Jawa,4.3,Jawa gives a premium feel,4,"Jawa 300 has an awesome braking system. Everything in this bike is excellent and it suits me perfectly, but I waited for nearly four months after booking, and the riding experience was kick-ass. It has an authentic appeal and offers a comfortable riding position. As for quality, all of the components on the Jawa feel premium."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Everything Is Better With Jawa 42,4,Riding a Jawa 42 makes you feel like you're the owner of the road you're riding on. It catches the maximum attention and the overall experience boosts your confidence. Everything is better with Jawa 42.
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Overall Nice Bike,4,"Stylish in look and best at performance. Also, smooth handling and control. Overall Nice Bike."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Good Performance Bike,4,It is a good performance and stylish bike with a good riding experience and power.
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Jawa 42 One Of The Best Cruiser Bike,3,"JAWA 42 is one of the best cruiser bikes in the Indian market its power-weight ratio is very awesome and the power delivery is very good. I can notice some light vibration in the high revs, but it has no issue and some serious issues occur at high speed. It crosses the speed of 120kmph the gasket, and o-rings are torn and engine oil is leaked. Also, serious battery problems LED to a lack of power delivery, and also this affects the horn. The bites of the breaks are quite good, and the front brakes are good as compared to the back. The instrument cluster gives an adequate amount of information.  "
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Low Ground Clearance ( Potential Issue),3,"It's a very good performance bike, but the only issue is the ground clearance of this bike, which is very low, making it less suitable for Indian roads, rain puddles, high-speed breakers, etc. The overall bike is nice, go for it."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Jawa 42 - Stylish,5,"The Jawa 42, is self-assertive, more aggressive interpretation of the Jawa DNA, featuring a trim front fender, a smaller headlight paired with an offset analogue-cum-digital speedo pod, wide tracker-style handlebars, and a youthful paint scheme with gold accents. Both bikes taper off gracefully into an old school rear end and are thankfully outfitted with small and stylish indicators that blend in seamlessly with the overall design."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Cheapest bike in the segment,5,"Jawa 42 is the cheapest bike in the company's lineup. This bike has a retro theme and sports dual exhaust pipes, analog speedometer and spoke wheels. The riding experience is good. I traveled 250 kms on my first ride and it has a good pickup. There is no back pain issue on long journeys."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Claasy Look - Jawa 42,4,"Getting into a rhythm with the road was simple-according to my experience diving into corners with jawa 42 was  with fluid elegance and speed. The brand-new, dual-cradle frame was built around the engine and combines the greatest features of traditional design with cutting-edge engineering to provide an exceptional ride and handling. Despite the less than optimal road surface, the carefully calibrated suspension performs a fair job of keeping both wheels on the ground. The front brakes with ABS are outstanding in feel and modulation, giving you the assurance to push the limits."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Jawa 42 - Exceptional Ride,4,"Getting into a rhythm with the road was simple-according to my experience diving into corners with jawa 42 was  with fluid elegance and speed. The brand-new, dual-cradle frame was built around the engine and combines the greatest features of traditional design with cutting-edge engineering to provide an exceptional ride and handling. Despite the less than optimal road surface, the carefully calibrated suspension performs a fair job of keeping both wheels on the ground. The front brakes with ABS are outstanding in feel and modulation, giving you the assurance to push the limits."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Attractive and strong,4,I am using Jawa 42 for the last 1 year my writing experience with this bike has been very good. I love the build quality of this bike. This bike is the best bike of its class and has more power and torque than Royal Enfield. It has a beautiful paint job that is very high catching when it goes on the road you love how this bike gets fast and fast.
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,It has excellent power,4,Jawa 42 gives a superb riding experience. I'm trying to replace the seat of my bike. The seat is looking superb but comfort is harder. Its performance is the massive and excellent power delivery. This is an awesome bike for long rides also. Jawa only gives helmet and crash guard. Accessories are not available in the after-market.
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Jawa's great bike ever,4,"Jawa 42 is in discussion among bike lovers due to its retro look and modern features. It looks like a modern classic roadster. It retains the retro feeling of a roadster fused with modern styling cues. It is an entry-level bike from Jawa. The mileage figures are not out yet, but we expect it to be around 40 Kmpl."
Jawa Perak,4.6,Ravishingly but has Drawbacks,4,"Such a startling design brings its share of negatives. the riding position is painful beacause the sitting is low at 750 mm with limitd suspension travel from its neatly hidden rear shock, the Perak’s ride quality can also be quite punishing over bumpy roads. Another drawback is that ground clearance has dropped to 145mm and the bike will scrape over sharp speed breakers if you are not careful."
Jawa Perak,4.6,Best refinement and comfort. ,4,"This bike is new in the market, but it competes with the Royal Enfield meteor 350. The refinement of the bike is great. Material quality should be improved. "
Jawa Perak,4.6,Not worth the price,3,"I think it is brave for the company to have taken such a hard-line approach to style, even though the result compromises practicality. This is a strict single-seater, and those large panels on the side have no significant storage space apart from holding a small tools and some papers. It is not like the Perak is loaded with features either. Dual-channel ABS is standard but beyond that, things are quite stringent"
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Good Bike,4,"Overall decent and amazing ride. The bike is super a power full pickup and is comfortable sitting, The Jawa service cost is also decent."
Jawa Perak,4.6,A powerful performance,5,"Jawa Perak offers a good amount of power and the delivery is relatively flat. But push the motor, and it is ready to play ball! On the highway, the Perak feels punchy enough to go the long distance, but the problem lies with its ride quality and seating position which tires out the rider."
Jawa Perak,4.6,It has a bobber design,5,"The new Jawa Perak will feature a blacked-out theme along with a single seat coloured in tan, and black coloured engine, exhaust and spoke wheels. The instrument console will feature a minimal design. The bike really increased the hype due to its bobber design as Jawa is the only one to offer a bobber body type in this price segment."
Jawa Perak,4.6,Good Performance,4,The bikes look so good than others. But the mileage is very low. but safety and performance are best. The comfort is to the next level.
Jawa Perak,4.6,Good Design And Comfort,4,"It's more of youth bikes. Like not a Cruiser or a sports bike. Just kind of a mix. It has a very classy look and feels good when riding with a unique design. But it is a bit like backdated in terms of the speedometer, no navigation system rear sitting style is bad. Its millage is pretty impressive. One suggestion is that when you ride this kind of motorcycle please don't think much about petrol then it will kill the joy of riding."
Jawa Perak,4.6,"Overall, A Good Bike",5,"Overall, a good bike will balance these factors to suit the rider's needs and preferences. It's essential to conduct thorough research and, if possible, test-ride the bike to ensure it meets your expectations. Always consider your skill level, budget, and the type of terrain you'll be riding on when choosing a bike. Size and Fit: Finding the right size and fit is crucial for a comfortable and efficient ride. A bike that suits your body type and riding style is essential for an enjoyable experience. Purpose: Consider the intended use of the bike. Different types of bikes cater to various purposes, such as road biking, mountain biking, commuting, or touring."
Jawa Perak,4.6,It is the best bike,4,"It is the best bike I have ever seen with the best performance, excellent comfort, and an awesome look and system."
Jawa Perak,4.6,A Balanced Blend Of Classic And Modern,4,"The Jawa Perak earns a solid 4/5 for its classic-meets-modern design, exuding rugged sophistication with a matte black finish and bobber stance. Its 334cc engine delivers ample power and torque, though a touch more could enhance highway prowess. Comfortable handling and well-tuned suspension strike a good balance. Features like ABS, LED lighting, and digital instrumentation blend well with the vintage charm. The bike offers good value for its price, boasting a standout cruiser experience. A few tweaks could elevate its performance further. In 10 lines, the Jawa Perak is a unique and appealing choice in the cruiser segment with its distinct style, notable power, comfortable ride, and modern features. However, minor improvements could refine its performance."
