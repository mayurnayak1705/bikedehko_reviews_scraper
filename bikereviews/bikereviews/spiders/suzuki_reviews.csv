There is no better bike than SF 250 in the quarter-litre sportbike segment. This bike is solely responsible for uprooting Honda CBR from the Indian market. As I have owned a CBR 250 also, I can easily say SF 250 is much better. The engine is smoother and more refined, looks much better than CBR and KTM RCS which look too bad after the BS6 update. Only R15 V3 is close to the looks but v3 is ridiculously expensive as a 150 cc bike. Coming to the performance, it is gonna be 2 yrs now from the date of purchase n this bike never had any major or minor breakdown apart from the battery issue in lockdown. It can be easily used for your daily city rides. With a ground clearance of 165 mm, it absorbs the bumps smoothly. N on a track or even on a highway, u can touch 150 easily on the speedometer. I have even gone to the beachside of my state riding it for 4 hrs. and has not felt any pain. With the stock tyres of MRF REVZ, it is the best bike as RCS also come with the same stock tyre now after the bs6 update n r15 v3 and even ninja 300 have MRF zappers as stock tyres which will last for hardly 2 yrs. The only bike that is better than it is RR 310 which has become a dream bike after the BS6 update but the only reason I didn't buy it was the unavailability of the Blue colour.
