Along with that good performance of engine also there as 110cc is there. As per my experience in one year it’s giving great mileage and comes with a very stylish look & features. More importantly, after-sales support is excellent as the hero is having a great reach of the network's and very trustworthy brand so when we shifted to Jaipur from our earlier place we faced no issues related to free services & 5-year warranty (not used as yet but dealership promised they will help no need to worry). It will help me in gaining good resale value too by chance if I choose to switch to another hero product. Now Pleasure+ coming with more looks and bold style along with Xsens and FI technology. On riding also it is good, sometimes you can feel not as a bike but that’s perfectly normal with every scooter, no need to worry about that. So overall it's great value for money especially if you are looking for a family scooter which can ride on all kinds of roads."

Hero HF 100,3.9,Good product but the package needs improvement ,3,Am 6 feet and the bike is small for a full-sized two adults. The seat is small.

So overall best bike for middle class families with that much of facilities whether look, performance, price and its fuel efficiency amd maintenance. I am satisfied with this bike.. Thanks to hero for awesome bike."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,hero super splender I smart ,3,Hope less bike fuel efficiency is  nil it gives only 35 km /ltr as claimed by the hero above 80 km. Very tall claims are made for its fuel efficiency but stands no where as compared to TVS OR  ROYAL EN FIELD.  IS MUST SAY THIS PEOPLE HIDE CERTAIN PARAMETERS AND SELL THE VEHICLE IN THE  MARKET.WE THE FOOL GO BY NAME HERO AND MAKE BLUNDERS AND SHED OUR HARD EARNED MONEY TO BUY THIS KIND OF TRASH
Hero Super Splendor,4.7, Best bike with pickup and mileage,4,"I have been using this bike since last five years, and it is  the best of all bikes. The pickup gears and smoothness gives a different feeling. The Honda super splendor, I would strongly recommend all to purchase it. It comes with superb graphics, broad seat, comfortable riding, gives me a mileage of 62 kmpl in cities and 67 kmpl on highways. I'm 58 kg may be the mileage would be. Initially I planned to buy honda shine but people said it will take 3 months for delivery and the price is higher but this machine exceeded my expectations.I am commuting to my office -IMT Manesar from my Res. at Rajiv Chowk- Gurgaon on NH8 daily driving a constant speed of 45-48 KMPH. Till date I have completed 800 kms and also done 1st servicing, but there is no change in the mileage. it is still on the 67KMPL. I am extremely happy with the mileage it gives."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,"Hero Super Splendor: Mileage, Price, Review",4,"As i previously owned and like the Hero Splendor, I had to invest in Super Splendor just to feel how the 125 cc version of the bike works. I did like the reworked side panels and the LED tail lamp. The 125cc engine of Super Splendor is from the new Glamour. The 4 speed gearbox has also been taken from the Glamour with a few adjustments for rural riding. "
Hero Super Splendor,4.7, Super splnder most comfortable bike in 125 cc segment ...,5,Hii
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Bekar bike,1,Bekar bike hai mai ese le kr pachta rha hoo 
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Rahul Panwar's view,5, Superb bike with the best mileage and Solid body. A quite trustable bike from Hero.
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Superiors.,5,This bike is best in range of125cc for millage and comfort.
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Very nice bike,5,Nice mileage and nice pickup and stylish look bike. Quite budgeted bike for a normal living person.
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Excellent bike and good millage,4,"I bought super splendor bike before 5 months, millage is giving around 65kmpl, it has ASFS engine, it giving better millage and performance. I will enjoy at the speed of 80  and also giving smooth ride when compare to other 125cc bike.The during 1st five hundred kms I was told to drive at the most 40kmph by the show room.  I am around 58 kg may be thinking about the mileage would be problem. Initially I planned to buy honda shine but people said it will take 3 months for delivery and the price is higher but this machine exceeded my expectations.I will pay only low maintenance charge for oil change and other general services, which is one of the great bike in india.  I have already done 800kms and first service is also done but there is no change in the mileage it is still consistent on 80kmpl. The only problem is the gear shifting quiet tough but never feel when you use it frequently. I recommend hero super splendor to anybody who opt for mileage and comfort. I recommended this bike to my relations also."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,does not look good but the best commuter,3,"Splendor Plus is the next offering from Hero MotoCorp after its most successful motorcycle Splendor. Splendor Plus was expected to have a good design that will make it stand out in the crowd but it was not like that. The bike is a basic commuter which is not designed for styling, it is only designed to produce the maximum mileage that is required make the rides economical for the users. The engine is smooth and maybe its the best in commuter segment bikes. The seat is long and quite comfortable so that long distances can be covered without being tired. The bike offers a mileage of 70 to 80 kmpl depending on the conditions and way of driving. I would like to recommend Splendor Plus to those who want a 100cc commuter. The bike is the best with its performance and maintenance cost is also very less, plus the service is only required at a proper gap of six months. It does not give any problems in between and can be trusted unlike other bikes."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Great bike for daily usage,4,"I have bought this bike 6 months ago. I am quite satisfied with it. This bike is really fuel efficient & in budget. So far I haven't faced any problem with this bike. It has really large seat for comfortable driving as well as for the person at the back of driver. Its alloy ring gives it a elegant look. Build quality is also superb. I would become happy if its headlight would be bit stylish. Nowadays petrol price is really going higher, so if you want to save your valuable money, then just go for it. This bike will give total satisfaction where the issue is mileage. I would recommend this bike highly for daily usage."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Two Wheel of Life,4,I bought hero bike 2 years ago .it is working good and fine. its average is 50 km/ltr. its look is awesome and still looks new.i think hero bikes are awesome. everyone should go for it. i love my bike. thank you for providing me space in review of my bike.bikedekho is good platform for bikers.it provide lot of information about bikes.i also use bikedekho.com 
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,low bugbett,5,"I have used Hero Honda splendoe for 10 years without any fuss. They are great built, consistent & excellent service support.That's the reason they are selling 5 lac+ bikes every month. In case of Bajaj Discover is the recently launched. You can't sell a product by just giving the names like DTSI & overhyping the average figures.Finally you have to prove it on road. Again they are having a very poor service support & nack of discontinuing their bikes without any prior notice. The new Passion pro is a soild bike with syle & performance clubbed together .Hero Splendor is the world's top selling motorcycle and the company has brought in multiple variants of this bike over time. The automaker recently brought out more interesting variants of the Splendor, including the iSmart which has start-stop technology and Splendor Pro Classic which is the world's cheapest cafe racer styled motorcycle.

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Budget motorcycle with good performance,3,"Purchased this bike one year back and i am quiet satisfied till date. Vehicle still runs like as if I have bought it yesterday only. It gives immense pleasure to drive such a vehicle, i would recommend others to go for it if they don't want to spend too much of money and yet want to get a good quality ride. The performance of this bike is good. Being a college student I often ride along with two of my friends sitting behind me [although i don't recommend this] and the bike never disappoints me. It is very stable till 70km/h speed but if you go above that it vibrates a lot and makes a lot of noise which is not good and also not safe. The speedometer of my bike was once not working and the service centre took good care of that."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Soooper splender,4,"I have brought a Super Splendor(Black with Electric Purple Graphics) on 1st Jan 2012. Before my ride I was thinking that the bike will give me a 45-50KMPL mileage in the initial days till the 2nd -3rd service and afterwards it will be like 65+(as many people said to me and also the company guys), But giving me a unbelievable surprise the bike is giving me 80kmpl mileage consistently from the first day itself. I am commuting to my office -IMT Manesar from my Res. at Rajiv Chowk- Gurgaon on NH8 daily driving a constant speed of 45-48 KMPH. Till date I have completed 800 kms and also done 1st servicing, but there is no change in the mileage. it is still on the 80KMPL. I am extremely happy with the mileage it gives. But it also have some cons, it dose not have a DC lighting like the Bajaj Discover bikes have, which gives constant light. Due to narrow rear Tyre control is not good on the bad patches of the road. But overall the bike seems OK. There is some doubt in my mind that is this excessive mileage would create any problem latter? Should I ask the service center guys to adjust for reducing the mileage? Please share your opinions!"
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Well Speedy and handy bike with good balance,4,"I am using this bike from past few months , i m satisfied with the performance and speed of it , its good and totally safe without much vibration and sound when i run my bike between 40-60 kmph , i think sufficient and very good performance in speed pickup and vibration as compared to hero passion pro, splendor + and other , "

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Good bike with some great feature,4,"Design and Style This bike has always been the most mature bike amongst all Splendor variants in terms of appearance. It’s a full size bike with decent looks. It’s been designed for everyone. At front, you can instantly notice its restyled tinted visor which suits the new graphics on its cowl. There is a gap in its cowl just below its headlight which differentiates it than others. Front mudguard has been extended from both sides around its front forks. The bike also features body coloured rear view mirrors and new clear lens indicators. Hero has used black colour on its alloy wheels, engine, rear grab rails and silencer. To enhance its look, Hero has fitted a chrome shield on its muffler which complements its chromed rear shock absorbers. Side panel and fuel tank features new characteristic graphics on them. Just below the fuel tank, it has chrome finishing on its utility box which can easily be noticed. It looks like most of the Hero bikes when seen from the back. Its rear fender and tail lamp are quite familiar. Engine and Gearbox This mono cylinder 125cc engine can also be seen its elder sibling, Glamour. It’s a four-stroke, air-cooled, OHC engine which pumps out a peak power of 9 bhp at 7000 rpm. The maximum torque output of this engine is 10.35 Nm which can be used at 4000 rpm. The same four speed manual gearbox with all gears up shift-pattern of Glamour makes its way to this bike. Acceleration and Performance There is hardly any difference in the performance of this bike and Glamour. In fact, you may feel its gear ratios a bit taller than Glamour for better fuel efficiency. It’s certainly not on the faster side but feels better than other 100cc bikes. Unfortunately it’s not as powerful as other 125cc rivals and that spoils the game in city traffic. The constant gear shifting may irritate you as the bike lacks power and its throttle response is also not very impressive. However what can impress you is the refinement level of this engine. It’s a very silent motor which promises you least noise and harshness at high speeds. It takes around 8 seconds to complete 0-60km/hr and after that it can reach to a top speed of 90km/hr which is also disappointing as even many 100cc bikes like Bajaj Platina manage to get a top speed of 95km/hr but it’s hard for this bike. Gear transitions are very smooth which is really helpful in city driving. The bike performs best between 3000-6000rpm and soon after that the power starts to taper off which is a big setback for this bike. Mileage There is a slight difference in the fuel efficiency of this bike and Glamour. Super Splendor seems to be more fuel efficient as it may deliver you a mileage of around 63-68km/ltr in city traffic while these figures may increase up to 5km/ltr on highways. Suspension and Brakes The familiar five step adjustable rear shock absorbers and telescopic front forks are supporting this bike. It’s a very competent suspension system which can be seen in many bikes of Hero. This bike has the potential to carry the weight of this bike without complaining. There is no option of disc brake in this bike as it features 130mm drum brakes on its front and rear wheel. Hero Super Splendor Ride and Handling This bike is lighter in weight in comparison to Glamour which improves its drive ability in city traffic. The light handling acts as a boon for city commuters. However on highways, the bike lacks stability due to rigid suspension system and small wheelbase (1265mm). Things become worse with its poor ground clearance of 150mm which makes it unsuitable for our nasty Indian roads. The bike is unstable around corners and its tyres find it hard to keep this bike grounded. An optional disc brake is missed badly at some situations where you need accurate control on this bike. Its ride quality would have improved significantly with the help of a disc brake."

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Budget and best bike in this range,5,"I purchased the bike new model HHSS on 29.5.2011(Price Rs54, 144 on road including Rs.560 for helmet) . The choice was between Honda Shine, Suzuki Sling Shot and Super Splendor. On test drive I found shine didn't have the pick up; the power doesn't come fast enough. Sling shot has very smooth gear shift but the Super Splendor had the new looks and on test driving I found the power coming fast enough. So the pick up and good looks were the deciding factor. It is a good commuter bike for city."

I keep maintain this bike since two years i didn't find major problem with this. This is a very good bike to buy. my father is business man and my father is also like this bike my father is also like to go for long ride on this bike . my father is also use daily this bike .The bike is ranging between Rs.45,000 to Rs.50000 thus middle class family can easly purchase it. This is a very nice option for those who want to make stunt. Overall, the shape and design is comparable to the best selling scooters in the market right now. By looking towards the benefits of this bike everyone will have desire to buy this bike."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,"Self start, New graphics",5,"Actually this vehicle is my relations vehicle as they went abroad I was happened to take it in my hands. First of all I took over of this vehicle after 2 months since they left abroad. The main thing that I notice when I kicked to start is that it start not even a single sound from engine came. I really liked this because its sound is lower than other bikes. I was happened to notice that it gives an awesome mileage, as this review was about a 2014 model vehicle (forgot to notify that it was the earlier times that hero Honda was separated). I think splendor is the first and foremost bike made after the partnership broke off from Honda company."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,A very good BIke,4,"Hero Splendor+, I had been using this bike since last six months and I am much satisfied by the performance of the bike.Due to office work I had to travel a lot including in rural areas so I need a bike with good mileage and good performance in rural roads.After various reviews from online and offline sources I opted for this bike and afer using it for almost six months I am totally satisfied by it. It also has some minor faults like sounds of engine gets changed after you take it to 80~85+ but it can be ignored since you cannot except a racing bike like features at such a low price.Its seat is also smaller as compared to other bikes.Its height is also lower as compared to others. Lights, body and other things are good.It is also not much heavy so making it easy to ride.I opted for its non self start version but someone can also opt for its self start version. This bike is best because of its low maintenance and its good fuel efficiency. I will say it is best bike at decent price"
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Usefulness of Hero MotoCorp Splender,3,It is a good bike. That provide a good mileage to the user . It also have a self start .

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,My Splendor,4,"It is a good bike. It is giving me average of around 65 KM/litre in city area. It has been a hassle free ride since beigining. The most efffective part of the bike is its gear system. The gear system is so smooth that when it runs it moves into fourth gear i can not realise it. Similarly the kick start is so much smooth that you can almost say that the bike is a half kick start bike. Braking part is also effective as it stops the bike within friction of time. There had been no problem with the engine till now. The riding of the bike in rough terrain is very good , the shock ups do not let u get any shocks from the rough terrain. The seating is also vey comfortable as well as the handle bars of the bike is also comfortable to get grip on. Although the lock mechanism needs to be evaluated as a lot of bikes in our city of the same make & model has been reported stolen, because the lock can be easily jacked in this make of bike. So the company should look into this matter seriously. Overall the bike is a good bike."

However it gave me about 76 kmpl in city, which was quite saddening. However it is not a bad choice. Go for it if you want a good combination of mileage and power!The engine is painted a smart gunmetal grey, the overall paint finish is high on gloss and the alloys do add a sense of premium-ness to the bike. Won’t turn heads, this one, but you never bought one to do so in the first place, right?"

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Excellent pickup and best mileage,4,I purchased this bike in November 2013. I purchased this bike for the purpose of going to collage and then i used this for going to my office.This bike has the potential to control my daily spending of petrol because this bike has excellent pickup and best mileage among the bikes i had used till now. I almost saved rs 1000 from this bike in a month on my petrol spending.The best part about this bike is its displacement and price of the bike is very cost effective. i would recommend all of the users to go this bike for the daily purpose need. The maximum power of this bike is 8000 rpm and the maximum torque of this bike is 5000 rpm.This bike in both electric and kick start type. One thing the company should improve in this bike is its fuel tank size only. At present  
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,amazing bike,1,Amazing bike really I like it and give good mileage
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Reliable but just reliable.Good 1 for all time.,5,"Ride Quality: Smoothness is one of the best in its category. Engine is less noisy and ride is enjoyable. Power: A big let down, not at all satisfactory at low RPM, but gains momentum after 40 Km/h. Top speed is not being tested but engine begins to cry after 70 km/h and vibration creeps in. The bike becomes literally uncontrollable at higher speeds due to its light weight body. Mileage: It is consistently stable at 65 to 70 km/litre unless used roughly. Electrical: Again below par. The headlight is unable to spot objects at low beam. The high beam also lacks good focusing. Suspension & Tyres: The suspension system is well tuned for most of Indian roads. The tyres however need to wider for better traction during rains. Compared to others 100 cc bikes like Bajaj Platina and Discover 100 (which I have tried). Initial power and pickup of Platina is far superior to Splendor, however you will not get that smoothness in ride quality .."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Very affordable bike by Hero MotoCorp,5,I purchased this bike on January 2012 when I was doing my engineering. Now I am doing Job but still the bike is giving me same performance which I was expecting from beginning. The bike is really extra ordinary as it is most sold bike for Hero MotoCorp. One best thing about this bike is its Mileage. It is giving me 75kmpl mileage when I purchased it and now it is giving me around 68kmpl. I think every middle class person can afford this bike as It cost me around 49000/-. I can ride this bike with smooth gear change and great ease. The maximum power of this bike is around 7000 rpm so I can easily reach at 90kmph. The weight of bike is very light and seat is also having good and stylish design. Two person can easily sit on bike. I have attached extra carrier on my bike so I can easily carry some stuff like vegetables. I am using it with regular maintenance service of Hero MotoCorp.  I have recommend this bike with all my relatives and friends.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Nice bike,4,"bought my HERO splendor plus in September 2014, as of me it is a gud bike for all middle class set of people. I live in delhi where traffic is huge and the bike gives mileage of 60 to 65 depending upon how we use.. If we ride the bike below 45, the mileage goes upto 65. Initially it gives lesser mileage as the engine is new. It gives a mileage between 40 to 50 only, but no need to worry about that after 2 months it  will increase its mileage to above 60. Otherwise it is a good reliable bike.. Maintenance is very low.. All other spare parts are reliable.. The bad things about Splendor is the head light is very very poor. Handling & Control is Satisfactory. Coming to looks, its simple and lean we can ride very easily, it is very light weighted and it is very easy to ride in traffics, we can just bend the bike like anything in between the small gaps of other vehicles in traffic. Whereas other bikes struggle to do this.. Pick up of the engine will be poor, but it is not a matter for slow riders like me, so it is suitable for riders like me. I don’t ride the bike above 40. But the service of the service center is wrost. It is better to opt a mechanic after 2 or 3 services. I left my bike for service in HH service centres for 2 times after which the bike engine became very noisy and rough. It lost its smoothness. After that one of my cousin introduced me to a good mechanic in K K Nagar and now I am leaving bike for service there.. Now the bike is very smooth and its good to ride. Now I have completed 9000 kms and there is no issues and everything is fine.. Just service your bike with a good mechanic for every 2000 kms which costs around 700 per service, which makes your bike more reliable and smooth.. On a whole it is simple and neat bike for all middle class people. But it is good to take a well known mechanic with you at the time of buying the new bike.. Because the HH splendor engine now a days is comparatively not up to the mark like before. So if you take a good mechanic with you he can get you a good one. To all of the friends, I prefer HH Splendor. Use it safely, don’t make harsh driving so that your bike will be more reliable and you get the lower maintenance cost. Thanks"
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,"always,,,,amazing.....",5,"s an economic bike with good price. we can resale it for good price. The mileage is good. its saves the fuel. its affordable for family.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Hero Splendor,5,"Hi guys, I have been driving this Hero Splendor a few months back and as Hardev said, this bike can beat others in its segment in terms of engine performance and mileage. The engine is super smooth and can reach up to a max speed of 90kmph making it perfect for the city rides. Further, I am very happy with the fuel efficiency of this bike as it is about 68kmpl. Since the day, I have bought this bike, fuel expenses are no more an issue. It has been four months, no issues yet.I was looking for a low-cost bike in 100 cc options which can deliver good mileage. Some of my colleagues suggested me to opt for Splendor. First I was bit skeptical as I have had heard that this bike does not feature any modern style and equipment. However, I realized then that the bike's engine is very responsive and smooth and delivers very good performance. Thus, I finally bought this and it is true to what I have heard. The mileage is superb and is abt 68kmpl."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,"Real fuel economy bike ,Very low maintainance",4," Actually The bikes from Hero as we hear from people are worth buying because it lasts long and gives a good mileage and satisfaction to those who buy, and since mostly everyone advice to buy splendor plus since its handy and has less weight my friend bought this in 2011 ."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,A good efficient bike.,4,We have bought this bike six months ago. It has self . It is running good . It has a powerful engine. All features are very good. The colour of the bike is also nice - it is blackish and silver colour bike. I really enjoy riding on this bike. The bike is working really good. No damage has been done yet. I would suggest this bike for a working person who uses it daily. It gives good average .The pickup of the bike is also good.But only one thing which is not good in this bike is the voice comes after we stop the bike. It is irritates sometime but it can be ignored. Service center facility of hero motorcorp is also good. They remind us the servicing date through SMS. It has 5 year warranty. They also give first 5 services free of cost. So over all a good handy bike to buy. It's price is also b/w 45000-48000.
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,about my bike splendor,4,Hero Motocorp Splendor model is one of the cheap and best models in the market. I had purchased this bike five years ago and i hv driven nearly 40000kms but know also it is in very good condition. The company said that it will give mileage near about 60kmpl but now after five years also it gives around 45-50kmpl. I have very good experience with my bike because its my favourite model and i take the bike for service regularly so that my bike remains good for long.. In terms of safety i have put onr more lock on the wheel side..And already there is one handle lock so no fear to lose my bike. My bike has alloy wheels which gives good look to my bike and for having alloy wheels there are some bebefits like if we have a lady on the back side of the bike then it prevents from any cloth come in the wheel and met an accident so alloy wheels help in that and above this all bike is of 100cc so it gives good mileage and less petrol consumption and above all my bike is perfect wid me.

However, at the same time, I am also not happy with its below average braking system that becomes a turn down for many buyers. Well, if the company works on that, this is one of the best Hero bikes in India.ortable posture to the rider. Adhyan you said that its looks are outdated, but I would say that they are simple and sober. Infact, the exciting body graphics adds visual appeal to its looks. However, I am very dissatisfied with the braking system as it is not even the average. It has a lot of scope for improvement. Otherwise, the mileage of the bike is excellent."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Your personal rider!!!!,5,"when it comes to ride with lot of pleasure and swag stirred in it then hero's splendor is the most obvious choice because it comes with trust of a brand which has been ruling the two wheeler market in India for about 2 decades and promises the quality ride with comfort.It's pocket friendly pricing has attracted many buyers and it's efficient engine performance and great mileage of 65-70 kmpl does not affect the owners pocket as well.I have been using it from last 4 years and i am fully satisfied with it . Hero's service support has been truly outstanding and located at almost every corner that you can possibly map out.Hero Splendor gives you the same comfortable riding experience even on the most different and difficult terrain with top speed of around 100 kmph it gives you the exact feel of flying in the air on highways/expressways .If you are looking for good bike with a decent price which comes with trust,comfort,performance and low maintenance cost  then you must go with Hero splendor to make your riding experience unforgettable.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,About Hero Motocorp Splendor Pro Self Black Alloy,4,"With its great mileage, unparalleled performance and legendary reliability, Splender has won the trust of millions and millians of Indians. Hero Splendor Pro is the newest member in Splendor family. Hero has stuffed this bike with new features to compete with its rising competitors. This segment of bikes is the busiest segment in Indian bike market and with this bike; Hero will try to take the competition to the next levelThis bike uses the same 100c engine used in Splendor Plus but it’s been altered for improved performance. This 4-stroke, mono cylinder engine yields out a peak power output of 7.6 bhp at 7500 rpm. The torque output of this air-cooled, OHC engine is 8.04 Nm which can be achieved at 4500 rpm. Hero has equipped this bike with a four speed manual gearbox with all gears up- shift patternThe alteration made to this engine seems to be effective as this bike feels more responsive and quick than its Plus variant. It now reaches 0-60km/hr in less than 8 seconds. Its revised gear ratios are also helpful while driving in city traffic. The power and torque output of this engine is available early. This bike can reach a top speed of 85km/hr. The crispy gear ratios remove the laziness from this engine. It still can’t go pass the engines of Bajaj bikes in terms of high end performance and pick up but feels certainly better if you talk about refinement. It’s a very silent motor which bothers you least when rev hard. The early availability of torque has resulted into better throttle response and that can be easily felt when it’s in big gears at low rpms. There is very less power offered by this engine after 6000rpm and that disappoints you highways. However noise and harshness levels are very less and that gives it an advantage over others. It’s not the best engineered engine in its class but surely has the quality and potential to impress."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,splendid splendor,4,"The bike is awesome. I have this bike from like 6 years, at that time there were no electric type. Bike gives 55-60 mileage on road and its best in its class. A bike that can be used rough and tough still it doesnt betray you. So ig you want a bike that looks good, gives good mileage and doesn't betray in the middle of a big journey this is the bike you should choose."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Amazing bike in affordable price.,4,"Hero splendor plus was my first bike, my father gifted me when I went to college. I always cherish those college days of riding on it which was amazing in terms of smooth and comfort rides especially in traffic conditions, as being light, it is easily managed with sharper turns in small radius.This bike have good suspension i.e. hydraulic telescopic suspension which is enough for a city road ride.Splendor plus is most selling bike of the country.why its most selling, it has many reasons behind it.First of all its look very nice which impress the customer.its look attract the customer for buying it.I bought this bike because the condition of bike is very nice. this bike is very comfortable.splendor plus has very good pick up.there are no any maintenance cost in this bike.if you are looking for a bike which average is good then go for it.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Spendor jassi koi nhi...,5,"I read some of the reviews that others have written on Hero Honda Splendour and I was shocked to learn all these features about the bike I had been riding on for the last year and a half. I started seeing stars and planets(astronomy buff u know so I like seeing special objects), well anyway I decided that I am gonna write a review on the bike that I admit not knowing much about and it is going to be a review with no technical information at all. So well the Splendour is a 4 stroke bike, with a 10.5 litres fuel tank. OOOPS sorry forgot no tech stuff(hehe kidding, I know you expected me to do some corny trick like starting of with a technical para, so I didn’t want to disappoint you). Well ok as I was saying, I have been driving my Splendour for the past year and half in Pune. Firstly, the people staying in Pune know that when I say driving its more like battling my way. Pune has one of the most congested roads where cycles, autos, buses and trucks have right of way, and they expect you to freeze in your tracks a mile before you see them. This bike has given me the kind of support you expect from a loving brother, it conveys me around the city, cures me of my boredom and whenever I feel lonely and depressed it’s always there to take me whichever place I wanted to go. Now I ask you how many bikes do you know of that will do all this. This bike gives competition to any bike that is available on the Indian market. Its cheap, its efficient to run, does not pollute like many other bikes, has very few maintenance problems and looks decent too. It has been a revolutionary bike in its own way, it was the first good looking bike brought into the Indian market(thank you Hero Honda). And in this age of FZ, Pulsar, Xtreme, this bike still holds its own with great comfort. And this is self evident if you look at the fact that even today Hero Honda’s largest selling bike is still the Splendor. What can I say, but that unless you offer me a Ducati or a Harley to own, on Indian roads, Splendor is my favorite bike to ride. So eat your hearts out you FZ and Pulsar owners. Move out of the way or I might just run you over when I’m riding (of course that could be because I’m half blind). CHOW! "
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Best Bike in this Class (100 CC),4,"Hero Splendor used to be my dream bike from my childhood and this is the first bike I brought and was never disappointed with it.  The mileage is best as far as my driving is concerned.  It gave around 55-60 kmpl.  The spares and service is a bit costly comparatively but it may be worthwhile for the result, i.e. mileage and best ride.    "
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Best Buy,4,"It has been over 5 years that I am riding a Hero Splendor and I never thought I'll be riding the same motorcycle for so long. Hero MotoCorp is simply one of the best bike manufacturers in the country that offers a durable and reliable product in such a low price. However, the bike has no advanced feature such as digital instrument cluster or tubeless tyres. Still, the quality of parts is so high that I have never felt let down by this machine. The chain does not loosen so easily but yes the battery needs a change in around 4 years. "

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Bike For Life,4,"This is my review of the Splendor Plus (April 2011 make) which is coming after I have covered 3000 Km. It is a realistic review and is not biased or favored any maker. Ride Quality: Smoothness is one of the best in its category. Engine is less noisy and ride is enjoyable. Power: A big let down, not at all satisfactory at low RPM, but gains momentum after 40 Km/h. Top speed is not being tested but engine begins to cry after 70 km/h and vibration creeps in. The bike becomes literally uncontrollable at higher speeds due to its light weight body. Mileage: It is consistently stable at 65 to 70 km/litre unless used roughly. Electrical: Again below par. The headlight is unable to spot objects at low beam. The high beam also lacks good focusing. Suspension & Tyres: The suspension system is well tuned for most of Indian roads. The tyres however need to wider for better traction during rains. Compared to others 100 cc bikes like Bajaj Platina and Discover 100 (which I have tried). Initial power and pickup of Platina is far superior to Splendor, however you will not get that smoothness in ride quality. Electrical of Discover 100 is the class bench mark. Then why splendor? Because of its reliability. I have never seen anyone complaining about it.  The spare parts are of excellent quality and the service personnel are readily available everywhere.  A very simple engine mechanism and a stable performance with almost no maintenance. Priced at around 48 K at my place it is cheaper than Bajaj and got a great resale value."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,super milage good comfort,4,Bike has super  design and very good milage. The bike has good comfort as well as good experience to ride. It is very ideal for the beginners to learn the bike quickly and easily. Bike has light weight as well as it has good handling. The bike has less maintenance cost. The average is still 40km/h after three years of running.
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Amazing bike and really hero bike....,5,My experience with my bike is really very very smooth. As I am using this bike hero splendour plus  since last 1 year and I have totally enjoyed its rides. As talking about its working performance its really very very good and smooth and amazing. As there is no words to praise my bike. In my bikes working time I have never seems any problems during this time and I have never found it in close conditions. As far as my knowledge in any of situation and in any of conditions it never fails in it performance. And as far as my knowledge I know that in any kind of weather I have never have to face any problems in its starting. Just in only one slab or in one kick it starts within second of time. Its space and its balancing is amazing. I am really appreciate its performance as well as look of my hero splendour plus Its shape and size and weight and accessory all are really beautiful and good looking. I have even single time not fails due to its performance. Really appreciate its maker.

According to average is upto 50 km+ per per liter. Hero honda is totally controllable bike. Pickup is also good upto 60kmph, but after that it requires a little power which is ignorable. It is a family bike not a sports bike. Front single light and back red light with is good design of bike. "

The sleek body graphics add some appeal to the bike while the front and rear face give off the same feel of a sports bike. The bike’s front cowl sports stylish graphics that enhance the bike’s sporty appeal as well.In addition to the impressive looks, the Hero Honda Splendor Pro is also a very economicalbike, an important characteristic for a bike in the Indian market.It also has 11 liters of fuel tank capacity alongwith one liter of fuel reserve.Finally, the Splendor Pro is powered by a 97.2 cc air-cooled, four-stroke single-cylinder OHC engine that produces 8 horsepower at 7,500 rpm and 8.04 Nm of torque at 4,500 rpm.Also it provides 6 services which also adds to its glimpse.Overall its an affordable bike."

My bike is always ready to go anywhere with me. No doubt Hero has taken the best quality components in this bike. and has done a great R&D to develop the bike. I also recommended Hero Motocorps brand to my uncle, brother & cousins and now in my family and nears, there are more than 5 bikes. I also recommend this brand to all who are reading my review. In few words I can Say ""Hero motocorps Splendor is your best friend forever""."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,best oil mileage,4,"I got the Splendor some 6 years back. Till date it has performed quite well. Mileage is around 55-60 kmpl. Mileage could be better as petrol rates are quite high. Electric start was not there when I bought it. Wished it had electric start. The ligh...ting is also quite poor. Wished the lights were brighter. Apart from that the bike has served me well. I would probably keep it for 2 more years with me.h. Fuel capacity very very good 67 kmpl on city ride. Very comfort bike, suspension good. Look is old but no problem. Value for money.*bike with good mileage, reliable engine, very good build quality to last for atleast ten years earlier I used to have splendor now I replace it with splendor pro.It has got 11 litres of fuel tank capacity along with 1 litre of fuel reserve. Hero Honda Splendor ProSuper can give around 63-68 kmpl of mileage. The maximum fuel tank capacity is 12 litres...it looks virtually the same as before. Its beauty, if it can be called that, lies in the details and the quality. The... engine is painted a smart gunmetal grey, the overall paint finish is high on gloss and the alloys do add a sense of premium-ness to the bike. Won’t turn heads, this one, but you never bought one to do so in the first place, right?"
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Best budget bike with capability,5,"I have bought a splendor plus bike about 4months ago. I can say, its a bike with all the required features for a middle-class person. It gives a stable mileage of 58-60km per liter of petrol. And coming to the pickup I was shocked because its 100cc engine is highly energetic and can take you to heights. I use to travel in ghat roads very often and I never faced any problem with the engine pick up or performance. I like the bike very much. Hero moto corp always manufactures the bikes with utmost care. Its a brand of standards and stability. Thumbs up Hero MotoCorp!!"
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,splendor is. best bikee...better than other bikes,5,"i have two splendor bikes...one is new and second old I   love this bike and it is wonderful. Despite the millions of cosmetic updates the Splendor has been through since its inception, it looks virtually the same as before. Its beauty, if it can be called that, lies in the details and the quality. The engine is painted a smart gunmetal grey, the overall paint finish is high on gloss and the alloys do add a sense of premium-ness to the bike. Won’t turn heads, this one, but you never bought one to do so in the first place, right? I have tried both Hero Honda Bike and Hero motors bike I feel nice drive on road, nice grip, nice look and fuel consumption. What Bike For On road....great! Long drive with this bike has given me no pain to my BUTT...I  have buy this bike because its price very low and quality high. Fuel capacity very very good 67 kmpl on city ride. Very comfort bike, suspension good. Look is old but no problem. Value for money."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,AWESOME AND TRUSTED BRAND ( INDIAN BRAND ),5,"There is no any comparison of the bike of Hero. As i have my Hero Splendor Pro bike , which is very very much better than the other brand bike. Its look , its color , its average, etc. , As i talk about my bike average its awesome , it is nearly about 65 per / ltr, which is really not only for show. So as per my experience with my hero bike i recommend my most of the friends to buy this bike. As per my knowledge the price of the bike is very reasonable so a middle section person they can also afford easily. Also if all the payment is not possible  then hero motocorp also provide a vehicle loan to buy this bike on loan by any person who wants to buy this bike. In my house we have four bikes and two moped , the all those vehicles are of hero ( Some of it buy at that time , when it is known as Hero Honda brand ) because it is a trusted brand as per our experience."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,bull of hero,4,"Now, all I want to do is ride my bike! There are absolutely no words to describe the rush you get while riding your bike.

It is a four stroke bike, so we can use it for long purposes. Its a bike for common man who wants a good bike with all facilities and better mileage. It gives mileage of around 60-65 kmpl which is more then 90% of bikes which are in the market. It is less is weight and handling is super. And the most important part, it requires less maintenance. I have 2 brother in law along with one brother, they all use hero splender bikes. The bike i am using is 8 years old but it has capacity to sustain in todays competitive world bikes too. The tyres, suspension, engine, brakes all are of very good quality and remains safe for 8-10 year minimum if use properly. My advice to all the people who want to take bike in future is that, hero motocorp splender plus is the best bike you can get for you and your family."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Splendor: A bike for middle class family,4,"Splendor Pro remains the same riding simplicity as its original version. Swing a leg over and you immediately feel in a controlled position. The seat is low – a boon for short riders and the overall ease of riding the bike is super good. There is no front disc option but the brakes are effective nonetheless. It is powered by the same engine as other 100cc bikes in the company’s portfolio – 97.2cc of displacement, 7.4Bhp of power and 7.95Nm of torque.The bike has Front-18 x 1.60, Alloy Wheel Type, Rear-18 x 1.60, Alloy type of wheel. The size of the  front wheel is 2.75 x 18? – 42 P / 4 PR  and that of rear wheel is 2.75 x 18? – 48P / 6 PR The ground clearance of the Hero Motocorp Splendor Pro Self Alloy is 159 mm while wheelbase is 1230 mm. The dry weight of the stylish bike is 112 kgs. Efficiency remains good at 80.60kmpl as per the IDC norms. The first gear is pretty short and best for just starting off the line. Infact, the overall ratios have been kept small for better punch during low speed ride in higher gears.The suspension set-up of the bike is simple and reliable and does the job pretty well. The bike still carries the suspension setup of front telescopic forks and hydraulic coil springs at rear, which manage to do an adequate job to provide a plush ride over broken roads as well. The minimalistic front design aides very much in handling the bike, which is very light in usage. Brakes? Drums on both the wheels, which perform their task pretty well. The Splendor Pro isn’t really a highway bike but still it is used by millions in various riding conditions and simply keeps going on and on and on!"
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Bike that adds ur personality,4,Very impressive with performance and very impressive with looks even.. Bike that gives u least trouble and the best part is it u can use it for any purpose so people want to use for daily purpose and lil bit rough go for this bike. The engine capacity is 100cc more than sufficient if u dont want to talk with air. Symbol for safe driving even. U can easily hover to 70 with no tym and even at 80 it does not show any sign of retardness. but beyond it i mean to say at 90 100 its dangerous as u can control it in an emergency so driving within safe limit is good and 70 is not a bad speed ... More than all this.. this is one of the choices if u want to be economical the mileage ya i mean to say mileage... it is awesome beyond 70 km/ltr.. even you do not give a proper tym to tym performance. So thats the best factor its good for person in 50's and even add personality. The bike which gives u least trouble and best output with least input

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Excellent performance,4," bought my splendor plus special edition (having black and gold color) before two years and now odometer clocked 42500 kms, yes in 2 years, i used this much. Where ever i go, i use only bike if i go single, otherwise i use my car. I rarely use bus. That’s why, my splendor, in two years, clocked 42.5k kms. I am a heavy user, day and night time. I am going to tell about pros and corns in detail this may be useful for the buyers. About my splendor +: model 2010, only kick start, no pass button included at that time. Pros: Engine: good engine performance, i maintain speed of 50-60, never let me down on the road in day and night times. No problem till now, only servicing and changing oil One day i started my splendor and i needed to travel almost 40 kms to reach my town. That was a night time. I started and after some kms, heavy rain started, and water was flowing road-full. So i couldn’t notice pot-holes. And where ever i passed the road with full of water i maintain speed of 40 so water splashed upto my hip and whole bike almost sank in the flood of water. This happened 4-5 times before reaching my destination. But the wonderful thing is that my splendor didn’t let me down. Even 3-4 cars broke down and was standing in the midway. I was surprised. Speed: i maintain 50-60km/hr in high way Fuel: average 69km in high way Starting prob: no, even in rainy seasons Cons: Headlight: I use my bike in the night and mid night also for some 150kms at times, so the very poor part is the headlight vision. Rajeev_vermacially when a 4 wheeler from opposite direction really make me full blind. This is very dangerous, not only 4 wheelers but some two wheelers like tvs, and bajaj also make me blind with its powerful headlights. -- Hero should focus on this part. As this is very important, nowadays many companies have come with headlight modification. Even in idle mode, headlight should provide a powerful beam on the road. Handling: Handling is not upto the mark. Rajeev_vermacially in turns, if you apply sudden brake in the straight road or in the turns, the tyre will skid even in clean tar roads, and tyre grip should be taken into consideration by hero for good road grip and handling. My special fittings: Headlight: Since i use my bike in the night times, i made some alterations in the headlight portion. I use 55/60w philips after making alterations in the alternator-coil. So now the headlight is very powerful, even cars, buses, lorries use low beam when my bike is coming in the opposite direction. Mobile charger: i have fitted a multi-pin plug mobile charger, that works fine."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,i will use in Splendor Plus i3s model. this one is best ride for short range. then my bike mileag,5,Coming to Splendor it's a bike which requires the very least maintenance. I hardly even change its oil for months or even service it. It's engines hardly ever breaks down and the mileage is around 80kmpl/hour. The service parts are easily available in any bike shops and tyres are also easily serviceable. This bike can go through any kind of traffic and also poth holes without damages. In winter it's a little difficult to start but you can always use the choke or try several times. The handle design is perfect for mobile holders and the rod at back of the seat is perfect for helmet locks. If you are delivery boy or office personal who needs to use GPS and lock helmet frequently this bike is having good structure and compatibility with latest mobile holders and helmet locks. You can also add anti fuel thieft lock below the fuel tank or add extra horns and usb connectionn with the battery for charging mobile. The fuel tank height is perfect for comfortable riding and you can add a leather puch to hold documents like bike puc and papers in it. The only drawback of owning this bike is it's a bad choice for intercity travel. Otherwise inside city use it's good. Perfect bike for Engineering students who want to save a lot of pocket money in repairs as it hardly needs maintenance compared to new generation bikes.
