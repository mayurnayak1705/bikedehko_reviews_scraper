TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,my worst decission  for purchasing this bike.,1,If any one want to purchase this bike then please dont go for it. I have purchased this bike on 23 aprill 2018 and today bike silencer is getting rust . Even the showroom owner and their worker were not having any sence that how to talk with a customer . The parts of bike very weak as if when i am riding a bike then it looks as fuel tank will be damaged. Over all i am not happy at all from this bike. So guys think twice before purchasing apache 160 4v . Once money has been invested then you will be in loss and company will be in profit.
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,New King of the segment,4,Have owned the new Apache 160 4v carb with rear disc for the past 1 month. 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Daily Commuter Stay Away it has Worst Mileage | 35 KMPL,3,Hello 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Awesome bike,4,I am very happy with this bike ...but not happy with TVS finance team and ofcourse rate of interest...The guy who is setting in the dealer shop denied to give RC he said when your first EMI deduct than they will provide the RC..After long discussion and arguements they handover to me ...
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Bike is good...but wrost service from all dealer's,2,In Showroom they say like mileage will be 45 but its not giving atleast 40..its only giving 35. .
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best bike in 160 cc segment,5,"To begin with this bike is the most smooth bike in 160 segment. Have been riding this beauty for approx. 1 month, and believe me this bike is the best of all the bikes that I have ridden so far. Vibrations are almost nil, mileage is superb for 160 segment. "
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,The wonderful and powerful creation from the team TVS,5,Every biker has the dream for his bike likewise me also. I purchased this bike an year bike and it has an excellent road grip and powerful engine with good mileage. 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,200 4v is better choice,3,It is all about looks. I have not ridden any 160cc bike before but I feel that it's power is quite average . It dose not provide the grunt need to overtake . Its power band is also very high above 8000 rpm so bike has a liner pickup . It is made for strait line cruising but not for city use . Turning radius is also small. My bike also has a issue that if the bike is in rest for 20 min then it do not fire up with self or by kick it takes 5 to 6 attempt to get started which is quit shamefully. It has very less milage of 35 kmpl if ridden in city. Considering its milage and performance I prefer 200 4v. Abs should be as an option. Rear disk is small.
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best Bike In 150 Segment ,4,"Nearly 1year 5months I am the owner of TVS Apache RTR 160 stylish bike. It gives a mileage of 45-47kmpl and top speed is 127kph & best in class throttle response and easy to handle in short turns, it has a top speed marker. "
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,milage r so less ????,4,this is good for race in highway and also traffic u easily chase any four wheelers but I ride this Apache 160 over 10000km and I found two problems on it 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best bike. ,5,Best bike  in 150cc segment.  great mileage of 45-50kmpl. great handling even in off road conditions. 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Beauty and the beast!!!,4,I purchased this bike in March 2017 for 83k and have been using for daily commute to office which is 30kms both ways. The looks as you can see is great in this range. The pickup is great as it's a 160cc bike and apache are racing bikes. So this is taken care of. The mileage however is 42kmpl that too when most of my travel is on highways. Its a sure eye Turner. The dragon eye headlights look cool. The balance of the bike is very good (I am actually surprised). But at the same time the handling is a bit clumsy specially while parking or in heavy traffic.
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Fabulous bike in 160 cc,5,i got a new bike rtr 160 five months ago. I love this bike its give me super millage of 53kmpl. I have this bike because it's breaking is superb it got 0-60 in just 3 secondu200B . that's why i love it's pickup. it's superb bike i prefer this bike to buy????

When comparing the apache rtr 180, pulsar180 and fz the apache rtr is the best but some of other factors are not so much good like it is slipping in wet roads and its body sound like that but handling, power and look is owesome.   I think if we are going to select a 180cc monster it is good to select the racing dna apache rtr 180,i bought a new apache rtr 180 beast 1 month ago. yesterday me and my friends gone for a trip on two bikes (apache and   pulser 200 dtsi) we had done a couple of drags.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,TVS Apache Review,4,"It is a nice bike, it gives 45 mileage in city roads even it is a 160 cc segment bike, The pick up of the bike is very good, Bike is having tubeless tires for latest models,"
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,yes its scarily fast........,4, i have apache  rtr 160... my first choice is bajaj pulser but when i ride the apache ...as we all know that apache have st meter in mode of meter which measures the speed from 0  to 60 and i think other bike are far away in this pick up and power i got the speed of of 60 km per hr in just 4.7 sec ..and am try to decreasing  this time period  i have new model of apache 160 and like much more than old model this model have extra features rather then the old one..
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,The Beast,5,"Awesome performance. Superb mileage. It becomes your best companion. Pick-up matches that of Bat-Mobile. Sporty looks just uplifts the feeling of bike riding. You can't miss long rides on highway if you have TVS Apache.The bike is way too heavy for slim and shady people. Tires could have been little more thicker. Mileage is around 45 kmpl for TVS Apache RTR 160 Variant. I have completed around 20000 kilo metre ( Over a period of three and a half years ) still it runs like a maze runner. Batteries are not working though. Odometer could have been more attractive. Controls given for accessing odometer are not user friendly. On a positive side, disc brakes won't disappoint you. It stops exactly where you want.It could have been better if TVS had provided a sporty look helmet, like Yamaha does with its sports bikes. Sadly, they would not givew you any free helmets with this beast. If you are an Apache fan, there is no going back. This is a must have bike for every bike lover. Riding on highways would just uplift the biking experience you just craved for."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Amazing bike,5," am using Apache RTR 160 since 7 years . coming to the fact rtr is more better then pulsar 200 pickup is awesome looks r simple end nice . breaking is excellent .Riding ling drives is very comfortable.if you r looking for a new bike better try this in affordable budget. its real racing bike. TVS was out of my list as I came across a lot of quality issue rumors, I repeat RUMORS about it. But thanks to my long time no see friend who had his 2 year old Apache RTR on which I had a short ride. Just one word. MIND BLOWING! Not just in terms of performance but so surprised on the price as well. I had the test ride on this monster on Diwali of 2009(I loved riding it so I wanted to ride it again), booked it on the same day, and got it delivered on the next 1 week. My first 1000kms with my bike was the hardest times I had. My right wrist was constantly cursing me for not twisting it, as so many silly craps were riding fast ahead me. But for the sake of my bike's performance and life, I had to take those curses and tame that monster within 40-45kmph."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Good bike,5,"I Purchased TVS In Dec 12,in three years I have driven 30000km on this bike.it is running good in all these three years with an average of 40km/l on delhi roads.It broke down only once due to spark plug.but I think its service centre are expensive they love to just put all new parts in bike even if they don't needed with bills of around 3k.after free service I am servicing my bike outside and found no problem apart from brake shoe,and chainset which I have changed at 25k km.overall pickup of bike is good.i have went upto 115km/hr on this bike.rear and front tubeless tires are also good.i am running with 6 puncture in rear wheel without any problem ,just airfill up at 10 days."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Excellent Bike,5,my grandfather purchased this bike for me. at the first instant i fell in love with this bike .  my experience of this bike is indeed awesome. i just love my bike the pickup of the bike is very good the bike i a little on the heavier side. the body of this bike is not cheap as compared to its competitors the mileage is good considering the price of the bike. the bike handling is great. you didn't feel insecure riding this bike on slippery road. the tyres are of superior quality with great road grip the bike does not slide or skid on roads filled with water the engine is very powerful i have easily ridden this bike  in hill. the disc brakes are great does not get loose easily and remain tight for a longer period of time. the safety factor of the bike is quite high because of these things. the after sales of TVS is a blessing the people are very much friendly. i met with a small accident and the front guard of bike got a little damaged the service Support guys fixed my bike within 4 hours and assured to me call freely whenever i feel any problem they also gave lots of goodies  with the bike when i purchased it from them i got free service 3 times from them and got 1 additional service by paying a minimal charge. all in all i am totally satisfied with my bike and service support of TVS

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Sudden Reaction,4,the engine of the bike is very much impressive and fast and the response time of the bike is very much less which is a very good thing. The latest iteration of the RTR had its tryst with aggressive styling but the results are disputed.Handling of this bike is great especially on turns and the mileage is not great but decent.the mileage is ranging from 35 to 40 which is very much economical for me in the tricity as per the price of the petrol in city.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Awesome,5,"i got this TVS bike year ago.it  isa few years from launching its new-generation Apache, so to keep the current crop of buyers from moving to the Pulsar 200NS, this facelift is their stop-gap measure."

Good :	Build quality, power, throttle response, longevity"
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Tvs Apache RTR 160,5,"bike certainly looks good and modern with every bits and pieces exuding style. The front is what keeps the Apache RTR 160 stand apart from the crowd, with the LED daytime running lamps flanked at both top edges of the headlight. The side view is highlighted by a big and sharp fuel tank with excellent knee recesses, which comes adorned with 'Apache' decals written and has some racy stance to it. The rear has not much changed yet, with the same tail light unit, with an LED layout to it. Though the rear side panel carvings are new and look much better than the previous one. The instrument console has also been retained from previous generation model, with an LCD displaying speedometer, odometer, two trip meters, clock and fuel gauge, accompanied by an analog tachometer and plethora of tell tale indicators. The engine and alloy wheels are given matte black treatment and looks nice. The overall fit and finish is also good and feels solidly built.VS Apache RTR 160 is an incredible value for money at the price which it comes stickered with, as it gives such oodles of performance at a price lower than the upper end, entry level sportbikes, without being sacrificing too much on fuel efficiency and practicality. It is a pocket rocket which loves to be revved every time you sit on the saddle, which no other bike around its price bracket can, and it is this trait which sets this 160cc monster from TVS in a league of its own."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Good n stylish bike,2,"[10/2, 7:51 PM] Saurabh Sharma: I was taken aback when Vikrant asked me to switch rides and handed over the keys of the TVS Apache RTR 180 ABS. Though it was a sudden shift but I wasn’t complaining, as I feel the Apache RTR 180 ABS is among the dark horses in its segment and I always had a soft spot for the bike. Getting back to the motorcycle, initially I used to feel that the bike was cramped for space and that the fuel tank recess was too narrow for me to grip it with my thighs. But I got used to the slightly odd riding position of the bike in the following days."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,sports bike ,4,i like it from 10th so i buy it its great bike for off road rides great to do stunts at roads on it best for balance and speed for me top speed which i was run was 130km/hr great controll good to buy this but just for avg is some what down so for looks it is a great as avg. is just 40 km per litre only so i want to be like as a sports bike it . great experience with this tvs apache 180 so if anybody want 180cc then buy apache

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Apache is an amazing bike by TVS,4,"I got this bike on my birthday in 2014, I used this bike very much. The bike takes several seconds to get in top speed. The handling of the bike is quite good. The bike provides mileage of about 40 k.m. approx. "
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,TVS RTR160 BLACK,4,"TVS RTR 160 is  a great bike,with zero sound,smooth road grip,and can run smoothly on the road.Its features and looks show it is a sports bike.Since it is a 160 cc bike it consumes petrol little faster,but the time it saves for me is unprecedented. I have black color bike of this model,there are various colors of it too.The looks of the bike is absolutely great,with style.It has a disc brake feature to stop at any point i desired,with great cushion springs to minimize jerking.Further it has digital meters with clock display along with date time,which helps me to check the time during driving.It has also energy meter to inform me the quantity of petrol in the tank.It also has the power start feature that helps me stop the bike during traffic jam or signals,and start the bike instantly rather than wasting time in kick start.My bike after 1 year gives 42-43 km/l which may seem less but it covers much distance in no time,and the best thing about it is when I run it at high speeds,the amount of jerking is minimal as compared to my old bike which is Hero Passion Plus,but my old bike used to give more mileage,but this one saves time for me.And you know that Time Is Money."

The Apache RTR is one of the best bikes in the 150cc-200cc segment. It is small and powerful bike that mainly attracts Indian youth. The bike is one of the best engineering product of TVS company. Its engine puts out 16 bhp of power that is best in this segment. "
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,"My Monster, The Apache RTR 180",4,"I live in Rajasthan and my name is Siddharth Rawat. I bought my RTR 180 in 2013. Yes, two years have gone by, it is still performing like a new bike. A bit of credit goes to me as well, for keeping it up to date, riding its smoothly and safely and following its timely maintenance schedule. It has got a decent mileage of 45 kmpl and have an awesome pick-up, it flies as soon as you pull the accelerator. But there are some areas of concerns with RTR 180 such as vibration at high speeds and tyres not having good grip on the road. The rear tyre is too slippery that makes the driver to ride it cautiously on wet surface. Other than this, the sporty bike runs fast and is good for both highways and in-city riding. I have taken it to a top speed of 160 kmph that never felt confident with the bike. I travel from Jaipur to Ajmer at a regular basis and I never faced any problem with the bike in long distance driving. I would always suggest you to go for RTR 180 over its competitors."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Wonderful bike,3,"Dear friends,"
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best motorcycle at this price,4,"After the success of Apache RTR 160, TVS came with its most popular bike having a 180cc engine. The bike looked slightly different from its siblings but carry the Apache sporty looks. The headlight and taillight are shaped differently from the previous model enhancing the designing of the motorcycle. The engine is very powerful but there is a bit of power lag before 3000 rpm but as soon as the bike crosses the 3000 rpm mark, there is nothing better than it. I felt that its gear shifting is rough but my friends and brother found it absolutely perfect. Its sound is great and being a sports bike, it balances well and is not problematic at sharp turns. As far as its price is concerned, it is the only option in the Indian two-wheeler market with so much power at such a reasonable price. Its mileage is also the best if compared to other bikes in its segment. Its biggest rival is FZ."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,TVS Apache,4,"Hello friends I am the Happy owner of TVS Apache. After doing lots of research on the bikes in this engine segment. I have shortlisted Bajaj Pulsar, Honda Unicorn and TVS Apache. Also evaluated the FZ16. I was searching a machine with good power and combination. I have waited long for FZ but waiting period is too long and also the mileage claimed by the company was too low in compare with TVS Apache RTR  so I decided to take the plunge with RTR."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,TVS Apache,3,Hiii friends
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Money worth !!! Awsme bike ! Loving it.,3," bought this bike around 20 days ago. First servicing is not done yet. Following are the reviews which I have felt: Pros: 1.Great performance. 2.High pickup(as suggested by Apache 0-60 in 4.5 sec.). Can easily beat Pulsar 150, Yamaha FZ series, Yamaha R15 in the long run. 3.Riding quality is good.Feels like driving a racing car. 4.Great looks and stunning graphics. 5.Most significant is its new daylight(like Audi) addition in hyper-edge new model. 6.Most powerful headlight in its class. 7.Front roto petal disc is good. 8.Reserve fuel capacity is 2.6 ltr. 9.Head is not too heavy like pulsar. Handling in city around corners is fine. Cons: 1.Gear shifting problem. Though service center guys assured me no problem would be there after first servicing. 2.For older guys little back pain might occur due to its riding posture. 3.Resale value is less.But in my opinion go with your choice. If you like, buy this bike.Once in a lifetime experience. Overall review, this bike is worth buying. Can easily compete Yamaha, Hero, Pulsar in overall performance."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best bike in Tvs Brand,5,"TVS Apache RTR 180 has essentially remained unchanged since its launch – barring the styling of course which was only recently upgraded – the bike still remains relevant.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Nice bike speed boost to much,3,"I have purchased it on 26-sep-2014. The bike is really good but there are some features missing from it like auto side light off, side stand light. The mileage of bike is enough it is giving me 41 kmpl now but in starting it was giving 50. Service center in my area is really poor (Kankria,Ahmedabad). Speed of bike is good you will love it when it is on the top. I think front wheel of my bike is not proper because when I start riding it I can clearly feel the wheel is tortuous. The bike is not much comfortable as comparing to pulsar 150. It lightweight than pulsar 150. Because of its lightweight you will love to ride it but when truck, car or bus will pass near by you the bike will unstable. The spedometer is too much hard it is very disapointing I cant set anything in it. The company should take care of customers I am not satisfied with the bike."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Apache name is enough,5,As RTR suggests Racing Throttle Response it is especially made for its acceleration on racing.Style is Excellent. It's the best point about the bike.looks really sporty and thrills one.Engine is good but fuel economy is average. 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,A beast ,4,I bought this awesome bike for a temporary becoz I loved R15 and plan to switch to R15. But after couple of days I realized this is the best in city traffic and some point in highway and for long ride.
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,My First and Best bike,5,Style :-
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best and Stylish Bike,5,Apache is a decent looking motorcycle with proportionate design and styling and the best this of apache is they keep updating its design on regular basis.  The most important thing about this bike is this is very comfortable while you are riding and also with a good mileage in compare to other bike. On road this bike is superior then all bikes(those are in its range in the matter of money).
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Monster in my hand,5,"I am just feeling thrilled while writing this review. One of the finest and best performance bike ever i have seen. The bike is really a best blend of racing DNA. The bike looks awesome with its very strong headlight , tail light, indicators and horn. The seat is quite comfortable. The bike is having a very high acceleration i.e it can attain a very high speed within less time. A very handy bike that can be easily handled though any traffic jam. The C.G is well maintained when it takes turn ruling out any kind of possibility to skid. The tyres are very good with good with and is very road gripping even when the road is wet. The engine is very smooth and the sound is really thrilling. The gear transmission is well smooth and the clutch working is really fine. Now coming to the braking system which is really very strong that helps to stop in a very short distance. The mileage is good with 40-42 km/liter. The speed indicator looks nice with its blue back light. This bike is really a trustworthy and a monster as well.  My experience is awesome. If you really wanna something special then go for it. All the best :-)"
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,My Apache 180 RTR is Awesome Bike,5,"I have purchased Apache 180 RTR in the year 2011, When it's newly Introduced this variant, But when I ride  Apache 180 RTR, Really i felt it's my second girl friend. Going to the handle awesome and design as well as 180 cc, Performance. The bike has the best power to weight ratio in its class. It performs terrific between 3000-7000 rpm,  It does 0-100km/hr within 14 seconds and goes all the way to a whacking top speed of 124km/hr. Sadly, TVS couldn't get rid of the vibrations at high speeds. This engine is surely less refined and makes a lot of noise at high rpms. There is not much storage space in this bike. However, for your safety, Apache 180 comes with a rear guard and front leg guard. The high end performance of this engine is not as impressive as Pulsar 180. Even i did race this Apache 180 RTR, what a experience, i have got from this vehicle. Till date i am using this vehicle coz i said this vehicle my best vehicle in my life.   Even i am waiting new vehicle like this. Going to mileage 42-46km/ltr. Thanks TVS for introduced such good vehicle in India."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Apache RTR 160- THE COMPLETE MASTERPIECE!!,4,"Every morning, after I wake up, I will be waiting for the time to press that sweet ignition button of my apache rtr, which will simply pump that unfelt adrealine through my veins.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Apache RTR 160 for Race,5,"TVS was out of my list as I came across a lot of quality issue rumours, I repeat RUMOURS about it. But thanks to my long time no see friend who had his 2 year old apache rtr on which I had a short ride. Just one word. MINDBLOWING! Not just in terms of perfomance but so suprised on the price as well. I had the test ride on this monster on diwali of 2009(I loved riding it so I wanted to ride it again), booked it on the same day, and got it delivered on the next 1 week. My first 1000kms with my bike was the hardest times I had. My right wrist was constantly cursing me for not twisting it, as so many silly craps were riding fast ahead me. But for the sake of my bike's perfomance and life, I had to take those curses and tame that monster within 40-45kmph."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,mt hero my bike,4,"I bought this bike around 20 days ago. First servicing is not done yet. Following are the reviews which I have felt: Pros: 1.Great performance. 2.High pickup(as suggested by Apache 0-60 in 4.5 sec.). Can easily beat Pulsar 150, Yamaha FZ series, Yamaha R15 in the long run. 3.Riding quality is good.Feels like driving a racing car. 4.Great looks and stunning graphics. 5.Most significant is its new daylight(like Audi) addition in hyper-edge new model. 6.Most powerful headlight in its class. 7.Front roto petal disc is good. 8.Reserve fuel capacity is 2.6 ltr. 9.Head is not too heavy like pulsar. Handling in city around corners is fine. Cons: 1.Gear shifting problem. Though service center guys assured me no problem would be there after first servicing. 2.For older guys little back pain might occur due to its riding posture. 3.Resale value is less.But in my opinion go with your choice. If you like, buy this bike.Once in a lifetime experience. Overall review, this bike is worth buying. Can easily compete Yamaha, Hero, Pulsar in overall performance..keep riding and ride safe..thanks tvs ...."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,GOOD,4,Very pain full during long journeys of above 40 kms. My body feels stress in handlebars and
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Overall good ,4,"Bought this bike on Nov 2014,"
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Racing DNA Unleashed,5,"The 177.4cc engine on the TVS Apache RTR 180 develops a peak output of 17.03 BHP @ 8500 RPM and 15.5 Nm @ 6500 RPM. The numbers here, though useful, do not prepare you for the sheer grunt and gruffness of the engine once you’re astride it. Sure, there are more powerful bikes than it, not just on paper but also in the real world, but nothing this side of the 250cc bracket has the same grunty roar as this. Thumb the starter and you’re welcomed with a deep throaty noise before the engine settles into its rather silent (comparatively) idling. Do not, however, assume the engine lacks refinement going just by its note. Sure, there are vibrations that creep in through the usual suspects, the handlebars and the footpegs, but the oversquare engine is rather eager to build revs and with it, the refinement rather improves.0 – 60 comes up in 4.7 seconds while it takes 10.8 seconds 0 -100 kmph, from there it goes on to a speedo indicated top speed of 126 kmph.Fuel economy (mileage) of the TVS Apache RTR 180 stood at 43 kmpl in city conditions and 47 kmpl on the highway.Coming to the braking, the TVS Apache RTR 180 is shod with disc brakes both up front and at the back.The rear of the motorcycle tends to skip under hard braking, but that’s mainly due to the short wheel base and better rubber should help reduce that and grip better. The front hardly dives in much and it is quite possible to brake late into a corner and get away with it.The TVS Apache RTR 180 ABS has proven itself a worthy contender for my attention and consideration. Sure there are slight drawbacks, such as ergonomics for the generously proportioned or the vibes, but the positives i see in this motorcycle from TVS would rather have me oversee them. It rides well, handles confidently, is quite efficient and has a feel that most riders can connect with. Not to forget, its got your back under tricky conditions with that ABS and you don’t need a better reason than this to get yourself one."

It has a cool sporty look with LED lights which gives a fab look to the bike. If we compare Apache 160 RTR (Hyper Edge) with  Hero CBZ Extreme than Its possible that Apache will beat CBZ on the road.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Not race machine it's Noise machine,1,"Worst bike.I brought this bike on october 2nd. I faced these problems1.Strange noise from silencerFrom the second day onwards strange noise is coming from silence (toop,toop...) i immediately took bike to show room guys they did something, then sound stooped for a day or so. From the next day onwards again sound started.Even after first service also i could hear noise from silencer.2.Noise from brakes without even applying(even after first service also)3.Rpm goes up and down automatically.When i starts the bike rpm looks good,after riding some kilometres rpm goes up(i.E engine runs in 4000 to 5000 rpm, even in neutral) and produces too much heat. Sometime rpm is too low causing vehicle to stop suddenly in traffic (in first gear)4.Gear shifting is not smooth.5. Poor servicing. I explained all the issues to the mechanic during first service He did nothing he just washed and applied some grease and returned it to me.6.Poor mechanics they cannot even predict the problem.They will apply some grease and oil to parts wherever the noise is coming the noise will stops for sometime but later on its starts again.Overall this is the worst bike i recommend you to go for other company then this f******* tvs"

TVS Star City Plus,4.4,i am satisfied,4,"I got this vehicle 3 months back. its a good bike, but its built for the cost only basic features it has. As promised by company and sales person, I am not getting the mileage. I get only 55 kms pl.in the service center they said it gives only 60 kms in test condition. even though I ride only in 40-50kms speed and the road I take to office has no signals or traffic. but stilll I get only 55kms. I could have taken a 150 cc bike which gives nearly 50kms. no pick up and its very difficult in up's and no pick up cant go beyond 40kms speed. and have gear problems with the bike, its difficult to shift the gears when we stop suddenly and again service center says tht is known issue and we need to change the gear in running only. not satisfied. think before u take it. I took a bad decision by selling my Suzuki Fiero and taking this bike, I regret for doing it now. "
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,TVS STAR CITY PLUS BY AVIJIT,5,"TVS calls this new design language on the Star City+ as 'modern flow motion style' and says its future range of commuter bikes will also bear similar styling. The instrument panel gets a speedometer with a white background, digital trip and fuel indicators and an econometer that shows when you ride in economy or power mode. Other attractive design elements include alloy wheels, an alloy rear grab rail and a sleek looking tail light cluster."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,blasting tvs,3,gud bike but...
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,STARTING ISSUES,1,The bike is becoming a problem for me as it has starting issues from day 1 and once it starts (after burning my precious fuel over choke) and riding for 2-3 kms and if slows down it again goes off. The company claims 74 kmpl mileage but how can any one get that if this kind of problems persist. Its on 800kms i have got serviced once still no change the service person says its ok. The service people there also do not how to switch off the setting indicator (the service reminder indicator) i told them this is service reminder indicator please fix they said chalne do bhaiya bike toh sahi chal rahi hai abhi koi ladka delhi jayega toh seekh kar ayega tab kara lena. This wasn't acceptable. My father told me to buy a hero motorcycle but being fan of MS DHONI and relation values i bought TVS. I am very disappointed and will never suggest any one to go for TVS. My friends and co workers after driving my bike says bhai maza nhn aaya. This very like hell to me.

I usually go on speed between 50 to 60 only, but mileage went very down 35 to 40 only. The braking system started to skid. The gearbox is really poor, I can't easily access it in traffic. but star city + is great in looks and design only.  The engine gets noisy nowadays. The clutch is hard to access. Though I service it regularly and still it gives me more problems. "
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Worst bike,1,"This is the worst bike tht I have purchased. Company claims tht we get 80 to 87 kmpl, but trust me I m getting less thn 60."

TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Simply amazed by it,5,"I have recently purchased TVS Star City Plus, which I found to be the best commuter currently available in the country. The time I took the test ride of the motorcycle, I felt the smoothness and crispness of the engine that made me fall in love with this machine. The person at the TVS showroom said that the bike’s average is 86kmpl and I was like Okay but it has been a month that I have got its tank filled to the top and I have covered above 700kms. Now I think he was right and yes the fuel tank capacity is 10 liter."

TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Most Stunning Experience  With My First Bike ,4,I am Karthik and i recently graduated and got job in Guntur.So after getting my first month salary i asked my father i want to buy a bike and my father immediately told me to buy TVS bike as my father was using the same company bike from last 10 years.Ans i bought it and then the experience with this bike was so awesome .The bike design is most stunning and coming to engine it is 100cc Engine with self start mode and quite economical for the middle class people.At present it is giving around 65 kmpl and expecting more.It has been 5 months now and the performance is great and cool looking.I definitely recommend this bike for one who wants both economical point as well as looking aspects.
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,TVS Star City,4,"I bought this bike in January, 2015 and for me it is the best cost effective and stylish bike in the market with good average. However I always miss the electric start feature. I usually ride my bike for commuting between office and home and it provides great average and never leaves me helpless whenever I need it. Touch wood I really attached with it and I think it is also attached with me in same manner as I'm. I have not faced any trouble with it as of now. I have suggested this bike to two of my friends and they are also very happy with it. On the weekend we always roaming in our near by locations with our bike and it feels pleasant. Last Sunday we went to Mathura and it was a great experience as it was a first long trip for me on bike. We enjoyed a lot however my bikes Tyre got damage while coming from there. However we got assistance from the local residents and replaced with new Tyre.  It gives an average of rs.55-60/Per liter for me. It was really a pleasure to share my views about my bike here. Great!! Thanks "
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,joy ride for moving within the city,5,"I own a TVS star city plus kick start red colour bike for past 2 years. it is a 110 cc bike. I love to ride it in the city for it offers me a very good mileage of 60-65 kmpl. it has huge oil tank with reserve capacity of approx 2.5 liter which is very good and i never ran out of fuel. the design is good which makes it a very attractive bike under 50k.  it produces little noise and achieves speed very soon. I have taken it to speed of 85 kmph while once travelling on patna - gaya road. till to date, it has punctured only once though it is often used on rough roads . even my father loves this bike. he often take it on weekends for going anywhere. experience wise, it is far better than splendor, i had once taken my bike to nani-ghar in gorakhpur (300 km from my home) and the journey was great."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Mera batman ride,4,It is with immense pleasure i am hereby sharing my expierience of joy with mera batman bike..it is none other than my TVS STAZZ CITY..it was the 1st model came with self start..eventhough i borrowed it as a second hand i never felt it as the same..brakes are no more inferior than luxury vehicles..i will recommend it only for travelling in kaccha road..not suitable for highways because of 2 biggest disadvantages..first beyond 70kmph speed vehicle wont run further fast..its only the engine that runs..second regarding quantitative performance per litre of petrol..even after regular service good maintainance it still gives max40km per litre dat too in national highways only..one more important issue is that if you raise beyond 60 then it will virtually start flying just above the road..at that juncture if you apply brake then 200 percentt you will be surely in hospital next day..i had met an accident by doing so..but still i call it as my batman bike coz i like both..and i have an emotional bonding with my bike..and after riding this bike you will feel other higher version bikes as abnormal..overall it is not at all suitable for long ride..go for it if you are a office  worker who daily roams around city for official purpose and also for people in rural areas..for its prize it is definitely do justice..Thank you

It's salient features , its design , wheels , smoothness on road is unmatched if compared to bikes of other brand, mileage is at its best because I usually get about 60-65 km/l. The quality which you receive after paying the sum for the bike its more than the worth. As I have shared all my best days with my buddy , my star city. It's quite a coincidence that the number of Friends I suggested to buy it they bought it and now they always thank me for my advice. I feel proud to be the owner of a motorcycle which can compete with any other brands motorcycle of the same category and will be the dominating winner. It is good to have a partner where you need it. I never got stuck in any place when I am with my star city. All the features that you require in a motorcycle it has more than it. I would say that it will be with me till time."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,"Perfect commuter bike, Great mileage",5,I had purchased TVS STAR CITY+  3 months ago. It's a great bike from TVS. It is loaded with 110cc eco thrust engine. It feels very smooth in riding this bike. Handling of bike is very easy and controllable even on  sharp turns. 
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,good,4,"I have purchased this TVS STar City +  couple of month back just for one thing that is to get maximum mielage as i have Daily run of approx 70km per day, Trust me it delivers what i expected for Star City as Tvs claims an mileage of 86 kmpl,"
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,the new star in the city,4,"first I would like to say that my first bike was TVS Victor GL purchase in 2003(on road price appx.43000). After 13 years experience experience I can say that I never experience starting trouble in hole time.due to long time I have decided to change my bike .My mind was fully make up for Honda bike when I go in market for bike first iseen Honda Shine(125CC) price was 67000 approx. on road  .After that when I come back my better half told me "" TVS bike dekhne me kya jaata hai ""  then we visit TVS store we amazed when we seen TVS Star City Plus with metallic gray color look is so nice and when I take trial again my mind changed and compare with price and requirement I have decided to purchase once again TVS and finally I purchase this bike on my both daughters birthday means 19.07.2015. After 2 month experience I can say that this is wonder bike with 55000/- on road price.following is prons. and cons."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,great experience with right choice,5,"In a much-needed boost to it's motorcycle portfolio, TVS has launched the latest avatar from the Star bike family - Star City+. First showcased at this year's Auto Expo, the Star City+ is a refreshed and premium variant aimed to attract new young buyers who are now spoilt for choice in this continuously growing entry-level motorcycle segment."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,best bike from tvs,4," i buy it on July 2014 @ 50,000(approx) its more than 1 year and still it working great. it is a good bike with all good features to have with it. it has a 110 cc engine which is good at this price  and also the mileage is its big plus point its easily give me a mileage of 60 km per liter. i buy the black color model. tvs star city plus has black alloy wheels which looks stylish and it has good capacity petrol tank and it has a unique feature called service indicator which blinks when bike need service.it has high grip tyres and has a good spring shock absorbers.it has good length seat and 3 persons can sit on it quit easily.it has electric start which is good at this price."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Excellent bike for city commuter s,4,I have purchased this bike recently and I'm fully satisfied with this bike. The pickup is very nice so that i can easily ride it in heavy traffic. As i have to ride 60-70km daily because of my job I'm feeling happy this bike is giving me superb milage. The design is ok for this price range and it is light in weight also. The riding sound is very smooth you can enjoy the rides for very longer distances. You can go upto 90 kilometers per hour speed and it won't give you any glitches but the gear changing is not that smooth. You can't expect it to go 0-50 in 4 seconds but it's pickup is very good for it's capacity of 110 cc. It is giving me an excellent 60kilometers+ per liter mileage in all conditions. And it is giving me even 75 kilometers per litres when ride at 60 speed on highways. And i faced problems with tires cause the air the tires decreasing some 10 points regularly. Finally what i can say is for the price range of 50-57 thousands this is the value-for-your-money bike as per my experience. Thank you for reading my review. Hope it will help you.
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,low maintainance,4,i purchached this  bike  about before  8 yrs. .  but my  bike  never  failed  me to  reach to  the destination.. 
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,"Good bike for this price , Need quality improvement",2,"Im from middle class family, other bikes on 110cc segment is to costly than this.. so I choose to go tvs star city plus, After 90 KM's run I found pin hole in silencer pipe , I went to showroom .. they accepted this issue and promise to replace it . I'm waiting more than 1 month still I didn't get that, they said silencer wasn't coming.. I'm working on car manufacturing field and well known about welding quality, as a manufacturer I'm surprised that how they send poor repaired leaking silencer to selling?? Is they have quality team or not ?? Is they inspected or not ?? Now I feel bad . I thought I should go to Honda or hero bikes . "

TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Stunning performance,5,"I was expecting the bike performance to be good but it gives beyond to it. The smoothness while driving, mileage , shock absorbance capacity is good compare to other bikes. If we use it properly I am pretty sure that bike will perform same as new bike.You can enjoy the ride simply anywhere. I loved this bike"
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Good bike with decent mileage but less speed.,4,"Since it is a mileage bike and not power bike so you can drive it at a max speed of 80 km/hr which I don't prefer since it can barely stand that speed. You can run it smoothly with a speed upto 50 km/hr. Above this it will create noise which is not good as it degrades the bike. Average is good about 65-70 kmpl. Look wise also good as it is not that much slim like splender and others. Well designed with good specs but for people who love speed, its not for you."

The millage is not as what the company claims. It's speedometer wire just snapped out. Its pickup is not good. I just wanted to buy an Indian brand but they don't give value for money. The only plus point is when we go for service it's good & fast. One star is only for service otherwise the company is not giving a good product. Very disappointed. "

Secondly, the bike starts automatically stop in between the road whenever the bike gets slow, it may be in traffic, or humps or near any turning, which was somehow rectified.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Price & performance,2,The scooter is not worth for that price.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,All In one Package....Im just Loving It.,5,Jupiter was my always 1st and last choice. I bought this bike in last month. It feels really awesome to ride this bike. Main advantage of this bike is it has telescopic front suspension which is quite important while driving on Indian roads. It gives you very smooth ride as compared to other bikes. Second thing is it has external petrol filling point which is very helpful I guess. This is very light weight bike. It has cool and stylish aerodynamics look plus alloy wheels which gives very awesome look. Overall this bike is a great package of all things. So just go for it guys.... 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Good scooter ,1,I have a Jupiter but I'm unhappy with service centre in vasco da gama Baina. Very pore services they are pervading for customer. At date now 4 days complete.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,"Good vehicle to women, and comfortably used by others too. ",4,"Everything is fine, but box with lock and key, mobile charger may cost Rs.300/- in lot, but satisfies all customers which was neglected by the comapny. Better provide to all owners of jupiter, as there is no scope for secured storage( storage under seat is for helmet which cannot be ignored). You should not forget that this is especially made for women and who looks for a good storage space, which is neglected. Better think again, if it is possitive inform me as my wife needs a storage box. "

TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter – Guts to Fight Honda Activa,4,"For many years, Honda Activa was the invincible leader in the scooter segment but since the advent of scooters like Jupiter, the king of the ring is in danger of dethroning. This is my review after driving my steed over 8,000 kms. At first glance, one will hardly notice any difference between the two as both looks the same. Jupiter possesses the excellent combination of power and mileage. Feature-wise too, it stands shoulder to shoulder to Activa. Though I read a lot of reviews regarding noisy suspension, I didn’t notice any such disturbance while driving. However, if you push your limits, especially on highways, then the suspension might play spoilsport. The external fuel filling has been a blessing for a lazy person like me. It’s not surprising that in such a short period of 3-4 years, TVS Jupiter has become a common sight on our roads. Just last week I recommended the same to my friend. Overall, I am quite satisfied with my decision and still loving my Jupiter. "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,WORST WORST WORST ,1,"it goes very smooth in starting but just after 12000km its a garbage.worst start,,worst battery,,and most worst thing you want to know is of about its service .i had bought tvs jupiter millionr edition from sneh tvs jhansi,,they dont care anything about the customer.they usuaaly take 4-6 hours to service your vehicle(promise of 60 min service).they try to fool you, i got my jupiter after 5 hours and at night it was hard to check everything and when i look in the morning firstly the key was broken ,battery was not working,,kick start was not helpful.they had taken 1130 rs for this bull shit service .advice you never buy a tvs vehicle ,they dont care about you.BECOME INTELLIGENT DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE,,#JAAGO GRAHAK JAAGO"

It's an engine, not a living thing to improvise, don't tell your customer that after 1st and 2nd service it will give mileage. That's bull shit. An engine is an engine."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Jupiter ZX is good scooty.,4,Jupiter ZX scooty is good for city. It's milege average is also good.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Very very very very very very very very poor quality bike,1,Not soon good because bike is not well conditional wheels

TVS Jupiter,4.4,just go for it...,5,Tvs Jupiter is the most suited bike for all who loves to go without gear. the rides are smooth and nice. the mileage is good enough. look wise it is the most beautiful scooter present in the Indian scooter market.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,A Wonderful Ride!!,5,"Riding TVS Jupiter for about a month now and I've got no major issues with it to date. The ride feels smooth on bumpy roads and balancing it is easy. Ladies feeling it'll be tough for them to handle this bike.. well it isn't. It's just as easy as it's predecessor, TVS scooty. Only people with short stature would find it a bit difficult. Mileage is pretty decent which returns more than 50 kms in the city. Costs bit more than other 110 cc scooters. I've got the million R edition with disc and alloy wheels so maybe it seems costly to me. Overall it's real value for money."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Nice Product,4,I purchase my TVS Jupiter on 01/02/2017; Now i can conclude it is very good Sooty as compare to Honda Activa (as I already owned Activa 110cc since January; 2013) as far as Riding comfort and smoothness of Engine.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Good Scooter,4,"TVS Jupiter is good in mileage and in the pickup. Its impressive top speed is 90 km/l.  But in-ground clearance they Mentioned there is 165 mm, But  One Bad thing is in any Hump the bike's stand is touching and it makes soo noise. It is better than Activa."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Lights  are always  ON ,3,I have got a 4G Jupiter 3 weeks  back and  find that there is no provision for switching off lights during the  day.  Is  this  by design or by rule  ??  
TVS Jupiter,4.4,real experience,1,Worse as compare to other available options. after sell service is very poor. mileage & suspension are 3rd class. no improvement even after repeated servicing. i have try everything to improve mileage but......result is wasting money. 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Noting Is Better Than Jupiter Juss Go For It,5,I was Using My Jupiter Since Last Two Years It Probably Giving Best Mileage About 45-55 kmpl And In Comfortability It Is Just Too Good .Better part is That it's  Resale Value Is Good Like Honda Activa
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Best Budget Scooter in Indian Market! ,4,"Though it looks like a scooter made for male, its good for females too. A female of 5"" height can comfortably drive and handle the bike easily."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Good bike if u have range of 50-60,5,It really has more space than activate 4g
TVS Jupiter,4.4,For performance prefer other.prefer this byk only for look.,2,Poor colour.poor pick up.poor.good features.heavy weight.good length only for gents.poor milage.jest 40 km.good look.poor luggage hooks no quality.foot rests and kick rod at same place so v have problems foot can touch kick rod during travel.poor shock absorbers.main stand very poor quality.good wheels.bad and poor tyres slips every time.mud gears should be more long.poor plastic body cover s used.very bad quality plastic.head light should be more bright.nice seat cover.nice look.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Very good scooter,5,I brought jupiter on october 10th. All good with respect to vehicle. Just make sure you bargain hard with respect to on road price. Happy riding and be safe 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Very Good Scooter in Good Price range,4,I Bought TVS Jupiter on 9th Dec-17. it run Very Smooth. i really very happy with this product. i had drivern 650 kms. i drives in economy mode it's give 57km/liter average.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Fiber parts are not matched proper extra gap is there,2,I have bad. Experience by dealer and finishing parts of fibre are not properly fitted and no one is take a responsibility of its and mileage is not satisfied it gives 45 nearby
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Marvelous scooter,3,"though it looks like a scooter made for male, its good for females too.  A female of 5"" height can comfortly drive and handle the bike easily."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Better than any other scooter,5,"I have always been a great admirer of TVS scooters but since Jupiter has been launched in the market. I have become a true fan of TVS. I also purchased this scooter for my sister, who has started going to college on that smart piece of machine. She tells me how smooth it is and how happy she is to have it and I think I am a better brother now. I brought her a Silver colored Jupiter and I think the scooter is returning a mileage of 45kmpl as per my calculations. She says that the ride is quite smooth and both the suspensions are highly comforting."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,BEST LOOK WITH GOOD MILAGE,5,"I Bought the new Jupiter 110 cc for me and I am really happy with the scooter. The new TVS Jupiter is one of the best scooters available in the market now days, with a 109.7cc air cooled engine, it churns out a power of 5.88 kW and 8 Nm torque. The TVS have reached the goal of having 5 Lac happy customers on Jupiter all India wide. The Jupiter achieves a good mileage figure of 50 KMPL easily on average in the city (Jaipur) and 55 KMPL highways. With this The look and the feel are really good, and availability of different colours options makes it a better choice of ladies. The beige colour panels are really good looking. It has dura cool seats which offer longer drive. And One of the best things I liked about it is that the petrol inlet is at the back. Hence, I don’t have to get down every time I want to fill in petrol. My suggestion to everyone out there is to go ahead and but TVS Jupiter. You will not regret it."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,"comfortable ride, good pickup and good looks.",5,"it is absolute comfort to ride this , i travel more than 10  kms daily it has nice suspensions."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,tvs jupiter,3, it was a better with compare to activa just give some more graphics in jupitor
TVS Jupiter,4.4,My jupiter,5, My name is Divya rastogi and I  Have been using TVs Jupiter for last 2 years . I am very happy with its performance. Its ride is smooth and I didn't come across any problem regarding to my scooty. Its mileage is awesome.... It is giving an average of 50km/litre. Its engine is good. It has alloy wheels. Seat is really comfortable and space under the seat is really good . its front light looks very stylish and as its back light. Balance is great... I rode it at the speed of 60km/hr comfortably. I have used it for long drive it has given good mileage and riding on my jupiter is  comfortable every time and in all seasons . it is really a great scooty to trust even for slippery roads in rainy season. I need not to fear from scooty starting problem which is quite common with other scooters in winters when temperature is low. It offers me one touch start which saves my time and energy and saving time is equivalent to saving money and at last I want to say that my scooty is perfect for me when I need to drop my child to school. Thank you..
TVS Jupiter,4.4,decent ride,3,"I have bought my jupiter four month back, the only thing which attract me to buy is its fuel consumption mileage but after using for four months it hardly gives 35 mileage now the good part is that its engine sound is very low no other  scooter can beat Jupiter in terms of engine and running sound.looks are also silent and simple,the service machinq told that it gives 45+ mileage after 3rd service.pickup and power is also very less but that is fine with me,coz i am riding a scooter.overall good scooter and run silently but if u want power and pickup then don't buy it. "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,It is awesome Jupiter ,5,"Looks wise it is the most beautiful scooter present in the Indian Market ,average goes near about 40 - 45 km per liter which is very impressive , having good space in digi and the best part is you don't need to open diki on petrol pump petrol tank is given out side the digi and that is the most comfortable thing I found in this , another best part is that it comes with a parking light which I rarely seen on anyother scooter of this range. "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Good scooter.could have been better...,4,I got my TVS Jupiter 40 days back.I have found the scooter stopping at times when the speed goes below 20kmpl.I have to kick start the scooter whenever it stops.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS JUPITER ,4,"it is the most suited bike for all who loves to go without gear.The high performance 110cc CVT-i Engine generates a power of 8.2 PS and its CVT-i technology delivers the best-in-class combination of power & fuel economy. Those desiring more involvement can take advantage of the ""Power"" mode to let me get the most power out of the vehicle's high revving engine.ype 4 Stroke,Single cylinder,Air Cooled,OHC"
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Guru of scooters,4,Its been 2 months since i purchased my TVS scooter and I think it is a good enough time to write a review on it.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Mileage & Ride Comfort on road is too Good....  ,5,"This is the Best bike for buy. Why?  I tell you. Because of its Mileage-almost 55 kmpl which is best in city, Riding comfort is too good as compare to all other mopeds(It feels like we are seating in a car),Eco meter and pass light switch is very useful on road, Looks are so sexy as we see in any angle, Blue metallic color is attractive, More space on front side (we can place a gas cylinder), Service center's service is satisfactory at least for me cos I don't know about others, Best bike for all users."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Additional Features makes it different in the catagory,5,"The bike is very light, does not feel like driving a bike. Means easy to handle . Nearing system is excellent as both the breaks get applied even if you press lever of one. Moulded wheels. Spacious utility tray. Helmet or a football is easily accommodated. Lights are always on as per the new standards for the bikes, hence should be kept on dipper when not needed or in the day time. Just need to see if they can offer a on/off switch if permitted by standards. Some guys drive always on upper and that troubles the other side drivers. In the starting itself got approx 50 km per litre average milage."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,My Dream TVS,5,TVS Jupiter is my first scooty in my life and i m very happy with TVS Jupiter. 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Very bad experience,1,Company claims 62 kmpl. BUT it have never given more than 34. Rather it had remain between 30 to 35 kmpl only. Visted several times to its service centre. ALSO serviced under compamy's authorized engineer. But all waste.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,BEST SCOOTER OF INDIA,5,"Suspensions are awesome for Indian road, Smooth ride, first servicing not yet done but mileage is about 50-52km/l."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Worstest mileage i hv evr had,1,I have purchased jupiter classic edition in 17 Dec 2017 which  is also known as for most expensive scooter in india among all the scooter companies. But when i have observed its milegae within 1 month its shows only 21 kmpl......now after seeing that i m regreting which i have purchacased tvs jupiter i could have gone for honda activa 4g. 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Best  scooty .,4,I bought a new TVS Jupiter ZX with disc brakes on 5th of December 2017. It's a great bike .I really enjoyed riding the bike.It doesn't give more than 40kmpl  in city limits though the advertised mileage is 62kmpl.The shock absorbers are excellent and give you a most joyous ride.I am unable to upload photos of my vehicle .BikeDekho says the photo should not be more than 2mb. (They should increase the size)

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Performance Of The Bike,5,Bike has A great Performance. IF you Want mileage bike Then Go For Jupiter.& If You Want power Bike Then Activa 4G because I have experience Of Both Bikes So Both Are Best. If Your Are Buying Jupiter Then Buy Disk Break Model Because Disk Break Is very Useful when Yor Are Above 70 to 80 because Disk Break has great Control.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,BEST EVER SCOOTY,5,Jupiter is completely a great segment scooty and fulfilled all requirements like good pickup rear shock absorber gas charged front telescopic suspension which no body else provide outside lid for fuel filling boot space and alloy wheel is also a advantage there is a socket connection for charger low fuel indicator if your fuel is gone lower than 1 L.Good handling in rush and there is pass light also and the one of the most important thing is that middle stand is easily used unlike any other scooty.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter The champ of scooters,5,TVS Jupiter is the second best scooter in the Indian market after Activa. Deciding the colour of the vehicle was much of a task for me as it is available in 11 colours. The suspension felt really good on city bumps and overall the vehicle has good performance. Although the suspension does not absorb many shocks past the 50 kmph shock. TVS Jupiter seems like a vehicle which has stuck perfect balance affordability and aspiration.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Very much handy and easy to test drive for new riders.,4,"Its been a pleasure to buy Jupiter ZX disc, it gives me a classy feelings and very much comfort when i drive for long drive. Though its pick up is little bit slow, but rather than it gives vibration less motion."

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Classic is new eye catching!,5,"I bought it a month back. It is very stylish and best in performance. The pickup is excellent and 12' tyres don't let you know about poudle and ditch in this mansion. The duel tone appearance make it eye catching. Seat is also comfortable. Side mirror mounted on it give you a royal feeling while driving. Leg room and dicky is spacious. Very easy to fill your fuel while seating. The best, enjoyed my mansoon date on it and she finds it very exciting. Thank you TVS!!"
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Marvelous scooter,5,"Style: though it looks like a scooter made for male, its good for females too. A female of 5"" height can comfortly drive and handle the bike easily."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Zyada ka nuksaan is the perfect title for it,2,Jupiter has a very big issue of self start. The self start becomes un operational from the very first day. Even the company mechanics are not able to find out the key reason for this problem. Due to this one had to suffer a lot and also the company is not changing the defective scooty which creates the problem on daily basis. So i don't recommend it buying due to this reason only. Otherwise everything is good.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,"True to it's tag line, Zyaade ka Faayda",4,"Jupiter has been a wonderful purchase so far. The mileage has been consistently 48+ in city driving conditions and the ride quality is very good. Has a good pick  up, leg room, boot area, braking and "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Mileage Issue,3,"It is been 10 months i have been using this scooter, the performance is Okay, i see it is giving Max of 40 KMPL, and engine sound so bad, Seat is soft and slippery,rear brake is not working from the day one, and service guys never fixed it. Over all this bike is not worth for that proice"
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Better then activa,5,"I bought jupiter grande disc edition on 2nd November 2018. Everyone was suggesting me to go with activa as activa has better resale value in there point of view. But let me inform you reader I'm now ????% satisfied with my jupiter, it's pickup is just good enough, there is no competitor in if we talk about comfort it provides while riding on road. It has all time best alloy wheels on both rear and front side wich activa doesn't have. Fuel gauze is outside the seat but i think fuel tank is not so big it only has 4 Ltr fuel capacity in practical life but milage it provide is great, usually I got 48+ milage every single time."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Its a comfortable and attractive scooter to honda activa scooter black panter colour awesome of jupi,5,"It is a scooter which has been designed to make your life as easy as possible. You get an external fuel-filler cap which saves you the effort of lifting up the seat every time you need to fill up. It gets a pass-switch, which is an important feature to have while riding at night. Should you wish to charge your phone, you can also ask TVS to fit your Jupiter with a mobile phone charger as well. It always had 12-inch tyres with alloy wheels and telescopic suspension. "

TVS Jupiter,4.4,MY TVS Jupiter ,4,"Awesome scooter I purchased it on 1st May 2014. I was impressed by the design, look, comfort and mileage of the scooter. It's a scooter and differs from the bike. I was unsure about the mileage claimed by TVS 62km/ltr. When I decided to check the fuel economy of the scooter I did following exercise. I made the fuel tank totally empty by driving it till the last drop of petrol. When it stops at 102 kilometre due to an empty tank. I filled 4.5Ltr petrol which I had carried separately in the can. I started driving, ( for safety precaution I kept half a litre of fuel in a bottle separately) after driving the vehicle between 20 to 40 km/ph at economy mode ( green indicator in meter ) in about 10 to 12 day my shooter stopped at 354.8Km. As the fuel tank got empty. So in 4.5 Litre petrol, I got the mileage of 252.8 Kilometre (354.8Km - 102km) so my scooter gave me a mileage of ""56.17Km/ltr"" hope that I get improve mileage after for servicing and it may touch 60 kilometres per litre. I would like to add that this test was carried at 50% of village roads n 50% highway... Damn happy with scooter... The only problem with a scooter is a bit less comfortable for a tall person like me of 5""11...So can't get the comfort like my Pulsar...But after all its a scooter. Top features.... 1. Huge storage space I can keep my full-size helmet in the boot. 2. Two luggage hooks.. 3. Great suspenshion..Thanks to its 12 inches wheels n gas charged suspension 4. Tubeless tyres 5. External fuel filling 6. Catchy look 7. Economy & low fuel indicators in metres 8. A hand brake and many more improvement needed... 1. Digital meter 2. Side stand indicator 3. Fuel reserve option 4. Disc brake."

Hero Maestro is on third position, Honda Activa is on second due to petrol opener under the seat, but I must say TVS Jupiter is on number 1 position for its toughness, body type and other specifications. I wrote this review after using TVS Jupiter for 2 months. Yes of course mileage is less but every scooter gives you almost the same so that is not a point.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,The Best 110 cc Scooter With Premium Features,5,"When I was planning to buy a scooter the first name comes in mind is Activa due to the popularity of its name itself ... But when I did some research on other options like Jupiter was my instant go-to choice. TVS Jupiter is the best value for money scooter due to its features, built quality, appealing looks and multiple variants as per needs! colours as well as budget. Need of disc brake option was a must for me which wasn't even optional in Activa in 110 cc segment. Other features were also very interesting as some scooters just get 12-volt socket where you need to buy charging adapter and USB cable but with Jupiter, we get a built-in adapter and us just neet to plug in the USB cable. Such minor features do make some difference. And lastly, my choice was the classic variant with brown and beige dual-tone colours with those chrome accents just look charming. And also most importantly Activa didn't have decent mileage figures at all. Totally Satisfied with my choice."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Stylish Scooter,5,* Excellent riding comfort 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Better Choice Over Activa 5G,5,Its design is superb...Echo and power mode saves a lot of fuel. Pick up and mileage also great. Compare to Activa 5g. I refer to buy Jupiter instead of activa 5g. service center also well staffed.Color range is wide so no compromise word come in color matter. Body is far better than activa 5g and access 125. I suggest you to buy jupiter instead of other scooter.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Lightweight Scooter,5,"This is an excellent scooter, suspension is fabulous, for a drive near about 100 km, it's a perfect match. Mileage is 50km. Pick up is appropriate. Value for money, lightweight scooter."

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Worth buying ,4,Nice option in the range of 110 cc. Scooters. Here are some points you should consider before buying this.
TVS Jupiter,4.4," A Punchy, Stylish, and Modern Package",5,"Honda Activa might be the top-selling scooter in India, but the TVS NTORQ is in a completely different altogether. The 124.79 cc engine with 9.4 PS and 10.5 Nm is punchy enough and helps in quick acceleration. Then the Bluetooth connectivity features like call alerts, navigation, and auto-reply to messages is another nifty addition to the scooter. Style-wise, I believe that the TVS NTORQ is probably one of the best looking and a truly sporty scooter."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Great Design And Features,4,This review is after 50 days of usage. 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Why Run After Activa When You Have Jupiter Classic,5,"Already having owned a couple of Honda Activa scooters in the past, I thought it was time for a change and decided to bring home TVS Jupiter Classic.

I hope the scooter is able to retain its mileage figures as the time passes."
TVS Jupiter,4.4, Fantastic Scooter For The Price,5,"Everything from the looks, performance, comfort, and features, the TVS Jupiter is one great scooter.

Hopefully, the scooter will stand the test of time well."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Comfortable To Drive,5,"It's really nice to ride TVS Jupiter. It has good resale value, very comfortable to drive, easy to use and it has large under-seat storage."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,"Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride With TVS Jupiter",4,"Good Comfortable ride but sometimes in the morning, it takes time to start. You need to use a kick or chock to start the Vehicle. Apart from that good ride experience, ample storage space.

The mobile charger below the seat is a very good addition."

I have already been to the service centre for over five times but the folks just can’t make it work properly. They’ll do a thing and the fuel indicator will work for 1-2 days before dying again. Since the scooter is under warranty, I’ll have to force them to replace the required parts to make this thing work. Not very happy to be honest."

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Zyada ka Fayeda,4,"Purchased the scooter today and have been loving every moment of it. Very pliant ride with no undulations on potholes, speed breakers- thanks to the telescopic suspension at the front and those 12-inch tyres at the front and back. Smooth like butter compared to my old Activa which was a workhorse but not a joy to ride. Has a large 6 ltrs petrol tank with a 21 ltrs under storage, both larger than Activa. Have done 1st service recently and no complaints with the service either, however, compared to the honda, the service center set up and manpower was less impressive. May be this was for the specific dealer I went to. Overall a no-nonsense buy and very satisfying experience."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Poor Mileage.,3,Milage is poor. The remaining things are ok and customer service is fair and the overall response is very poor and the price may be fixed and to avoid bargin at the showroom.

Also, I expected it to deliver a mileage of at least 42kmpl to 45kmpl but sadly, I had face disappointment. It delivers a mileage of 30kmpl only, and the engine vibrates a lot at high speed. I believe that this bike is good for daily use but those who want a speedy bike for long drives and fast rides, it’s just a waste of money."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best in the class.,4,Very comfortable bike with excellent power before first service I'm getting 45kmpl. Expecting above 50kmpl after the first service and the look is very stylish people looks twice once they saw on road. This is a proper racing bike.

Best choice for daily uses like an office to work and vice versa. You can also use it for long rides, but it won’t be much comfortable for it, and as per my experience, it also vibrates a lot at high speed.

The LED DRLs are bigger and better than before and the headlamp is now split into two parts for the low and high beam. The company claims that the new unit offers segment-best penetration and spread and we will be able to confirm this only when the bike comes to us for a proper road test. Apart from this, the BS6 model gets new race-inspired graphics, all thanks to which the bike looks more appealing than before. The rest of the elements like side panels, fuel tank, exhaust, and the rear section are exactly the same as the previous BS4 model.

I went to the show room and after 24 hrs, they returned back my vehicle by replacing faulty float pin (as they say). But on my surprise, now petrol drain is increased by 2 folds. Annoyed with this issue, again I handed over my NTORQ to the same agency. I came to know that other NTORQ owner also facing the same issue which yet to be resolved. It may be a serious design fault that to be corrected at earliest. Petrol drainage issue may cause severe inconvenience and may catch fire.

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Throttle goes vroom! ,4,"The vehicle is one of a kind , you get that wide section tyre on the rear , mean looking side profile and all the thing that would have been catching your attraction . It is no less than a bike . The bassy exhaust just fills up your heart , when you want a performance then mileage isn't a concern . If you're a tourer kind of person this vehicle easily rolls at 100kmph without any disturbance or any kind of vibration . It has got everything that a person would have been looking for in a bike apart from that geared engine . I would give it a 4/5 stars . It misses out on 1 star because of its lacing feature of connectivity to IOS ! "

And the overall aesthetics of the scooter are just killer."
TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Entorq gets a 4,4,"I drove the Entorq yesterday for a very short distance and the vehicle is absoluteley amazing compared to the other 125 scooters. TVS has gone a notch above the rest. The styling, the finish and the handling is indicative that TVS has come a long way in refining their scooters. After testing both Aprillia and Entorq, I felt Entorq handling and the road grip is more than the Aprillia. If TVS had managed to get the google maps on the screen then it would have been excellent. I would settle for 4* for this scooter. I have already booked the scooter and am waiting for the delivery."

I actually cannot give any remark as I have only used this for city drive . I have not gone on any long trip as yet ,except for the congested foot space I find it a powerful machine.

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,The beast on the road..,5,"I've been using the NTORQ125 since one month and this scooty is just awesome. Till now no complaints. In terms of pickup, power looks it is all above. The mileage is also good , I'm getting mileage of 43kmpl. This is the average mileage of  most of the scooty in the market. Overall I'm happy with the scooty. Just go for it. The smart bluetooth console is very nice. While driving at least I can know that who is calling me as the name of the person is getting displayed. At high speeds it gives a nice balance. I've driven up to 96kmph. Guys the exhaust sound of this scooty is some what like Apache.. U will feel like u r driving a bike. It's too good and different."
TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Awesome look and a good ride!!,5,Different from traditional scooter. Look and engine sound is just awesome. Sleek look.

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,"The new TVS NTorq 125 scooter ticks all the right boxes when it comes to performance, refinement, fe",5,"Fun to ride. Edgy and stylish! TVS says that the design of the NTorq 125 has been inspired from stealth fighter jets. Looking at all the edges and panels, one might get the idea that the design is too busy, but looking at it in the flesh, it feels just right. TVS wanted to target the millennials and what it calls 'Generation Z' with the NTorq 125 and has kept the styling as such. The front apron is nicely raked with LED DRLs that are integrated into the headlamp unit. View it from the rear and first thing that you notice are the triangular faux vents flanking the tail lamp, which look rather stylish and butch. Adding to the scooter's sportiness are bits of faux carbon fibre finish and aluminium footpegs. The overall design itself is fresh and likeable. So the looks of the scooter gets a big thumbs up. The average of bike before servicing  is about 35-40 and after service it gives around 40-45 in city on highway it will give you 45-55 overall it is a package and gives you all that you need in your daily ride. "
TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,"Ntor 125, review",4,"I have spent another two months in the city commuting on our TVS Ntorq and have managed to add another 2000km on the clock.

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,"Light body, good look",4,"TVS Ntorq is a way to go scooty. The large apron-mounted headlamp gets a bowtie DRL lamp that’s reminiscent of the Chevrolet badge. Flanking it are two small faux air scoops which make it look so cool that anyone would love to buy it. However, It is very light and catches speed very fast, so you need to be careful handing this demon."

It's now been almost 6 months and the bike has been an absolute blast to ride in the city. It happily embarrasses bigger bikes and it's so much fun to ride.

However it definitely an added feature."

Very stable, light, great pick up, fuel efficiency over 40 km to a litre. Only Con so far is ride is slightly bumpy on pockmarked roads inspite of telescopic suspension.

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Starting Problem,1,Never buy a TVS bike. Faulty bikes made by TVS company. And never buy bikes from Suryapratap motors as well. Recently I bought Ntorq from Bangalore.After buying within one week only it gave starting problem .so many times it has stopped in the ring road. My friends suggested that go for Honda Activa as it is a proven product and they have been using Honda Activa since five years still they have not faced a situation where the scooty has been stopped in the middle of the road.
TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Starting problem,1,"Never buy TVS scooters. Faulty scooters made by TVS company. And never buy scooters from Suryapratap Motors as well. Recently I bought a TVS NTORQ from Suryapratap Motors, Bangalore. After buying within one week only it gave the starting problem. So many times it has stopped on the Ring Road, Bellandur, near to eco space while coming back from office. My friends suggested that go for Honda Activa as it is a proven product and they have been using Honda Activa since five years still they have not faced a situation where the scooter has been stopped in the middle of the road. Even they do not start their scooter through kick regularly as well till now. And also my sister is using Honda Activa for five years in a row. I can say don't go for the features in TVS scooters, it is of no use if your scooter is going to stop in the middle of the road. Why should I take tension after spending 85000 Rs to get a faulty new scooter. TVS guys are telling me it has 5 years of warranty, if any problems will occur in future we will take care of that. But my concern is why every time I should feel insecure that this scooter might stop in the middle. I am totally harassed. And believe me, I will make sure that TVS ratings will be zero from now onwards. I will post this review everywhere and make sure not a single TVS bike will sell after some time from any of your showroom in India. I will make youtube videos and everything. Requesting all the online users to check other forums as well for reviews of TVS. One classic example you can see from your eyes that if you visit any showroom in Bangalore of TVS see the public and visit showrooms of Honda Activa and see the buyers. And believe me, you will get empty showrooms of TVS as compared to Honda Activa. And make your decision on your self. I want my money back to buy Honda Activa. That's all."

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,It is a good scooter with superb mileage,5,"TVS NTORQ 125 is really one of the best scooters in the 125 CC segment. I am done with 2500 KMS and I feel it a worth buy for your everyday use to office. I use it with pillion every day for about 45-50 KMS and it never disappoints you. Power is just what you need in the city or on highways. Sound is best compared to any scooter. Comfortable to sit and ride for long hours also. The connectivity system is good for android user, However, except for the call display and few digital indicators, nothing much is useful in day to day life. Map / Direction is not effective in the real world, however, it is definitely an added feature. Improvements - Yes, the petrol tank size is too less compared to the mileage we get. The full tank gives you 150 KMS which is too less as I have to top up my tank every third day. I am getting constant mileage of 35 KMPL, hoping it may improve after the second service which is due already at 2500 KMS. Another drawback is the unavailability of Apple Phone's connectivity. This should be treated immediately as iPhone users like me will start avoiding the scooter despite having such good features."

TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Troublemaker,1,Bought this so called beast last month on 15th. The dealer made me wait for almost 3 weeks to deliver in desired colour.

From that day it became a daily routine and do not start without it. Later it stopped working that too. In middle of a road I have to drag the bike to get it started and look like a fool running with a new bike .

TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Bang for the Buck!,4,"I have completed 2500kms on the bike and it has been a pleasure riding it every kilometer. The bike feels at home when it is in traffic and it pulls like a breeze with its good low end and excellent midrange. In the highways though the bike feels a bit out of breath after 120kmph, obviously the reason being the short gearing with the large rear sprocket. As a result its not bright to expect a strong top end from the bike. The bike is perfect in the way it is designed. The maintenance is also inexpensive as it's a TVS. Overall a sporty and a perfectly handling bike."
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Wonderful bike!!,5,"A very balanced bike in the 200 segment. It is a perfect balance between power and safety. Although the power is a bit less than ns200 and rc200, this bike will ensure that you are very much safe on the road, with the dual channel ABS and many other features.  Even the power is very good and the bike never disappoints you on the road. It would be wrong to compare this to KTM or NS because although they are same segment, their purpose is completely different. I am using this one as a daily commute bike and very much satisfied with the performance. The only con is it's headlights. The headlight is completely useless. Even a mobile LED torch is better than this headlight. In night time, you cannot see anything on the road because the halogen light is very dim even in up beam. The horn is very good, and sounds very nice like a car horn. And the best part about this bike is the exhaust note. The exhaust sound is just wonderful. The exhaust note grabs everyone's attention and you'll love it. The ABS is wonderful. You can cruise at high speed without worrying much about the braking. Braking is wonderful."
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,perfect for city and highways,4,"its been more than one year i have been using this bike now, there was waiting period for a week i guess but it was worth waiting for."
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Apache 2004v,4,A very good bike and ride quality is awesome . I'm happy to purchase this bike.
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Apache RTR 200 4v 2.0 cons. And pros.,5,This was really a excellent bike and the abs works fine and slipper clutch feature was also really good . But the price is yet good .
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Design And features ,5,The bike design is awesome and all features are good for this budget.

TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Racing Time,5,This bike is  very Good on Runaway and Its Controlling power is extreme.
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,my bad luck,2,after buying this bike i faced a huge prblm u can say.my bike's prblm is related to engine.top speed achived is 100 only when it was new.tody its top speed is 88kmph.when try to throttle it up it jurks a lot n a khat khat noice is coming frm the engine.milage is also flactuating like 22 15 32 km/L. went to service center many times.but no result is out.dnt know what to do.this was my dream bike thats why i gave it 2 str.otherwise 2 star is not for this bike
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,don't miss it ,5,its  very cool in look and very awesome bike. the speed of the bike is impressive in acceleration and the the handling is superb than the others bikes of TVS and it has double exhaust but in other apache single exhaust very impressive  in all specification 
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Beastly performance!,5,The bike is absolutely gorgeous with looks and performance but the service center of TVS is absolute fraud and the worst after sales service is shit. You should go for KTM or Bajaj their service is a lot better. However the bike sounds really good like a mini bullet and pickup is nice the best thing I like about the bike is the console and the matte finish.
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,RTR racing  trotel  response. A awesome  competitor btw 200cc,5,1 Appearance  - I have recently  buy new matte black variant of rtr 200  in  indore $ i get awesome  feedback  from spectators. bike look amazing. 
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,The bike that flows..  ,4,I was in HYD for my training..  As i returned i got this bike as a gift from dad.. Though we have booked the bike last month(DEC).. Reason y have i given the title so..  Is the bike just keeps you cruising so well..  The power delivery is so linear.. You wont feel any sort of lag while you drive along in the city..  I have not driven it much though(400km)..  Take these word as a first impression from my side..  I dont rush or rash while i drive..  So cannot comment on the hi-end power and speed..  I also own a RS200 which is very planted at hi speeds but struggles a bit in city..  So basically i understand what my need is..  And i have made a good call going for apache rather than any other..  
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Brst performer around 1 lakh,5,Great bike....Best performer.......Lack of 6th gear is the only problem.......Gives a mileage of 40 in city riding and 45  in highways...
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Switching Loyalty,5,I've been a hardcore fan of Pulsar and still believe it is the best thing that has happened to Indian biking. Pulsar upped the game for Indian manufacturers and has brought every other bike maker (Desi/ Videsi) to a larger arena.
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,the best racing beast,5,I got this bike on august 2017 to be very honest with you guys who ever will read the review im not going to be biased but I will right exactly what I have felt after buying the bike.

The look and style of the bike is also eye catching. If u want a sports bike within your budger then u should go for it.. Value for money"
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Astonishing look with decent performance.,5,Pros
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,So bought my 3rd bike!! ,4,"Its been 2 months since i bought my apache. Its been a good experience so far, very good for city riding, the power delivery is very linear, low end torque is very good.. So this beast is best for riding in city traffic, believe me when i say this, i have driven 200ns for a week, but the ride experience you get in apache 200 is just perfect, there is literally no vibration in bike even at high rpms its really smooth, so done with the good points. Now something which tvs should improve in every apache there in the market is braking, brakes needs improvement, I am pretty disappointed with brakes, and tvs if you launch the bike with abs in 2016 you should provide it in bike, its been 1 year since release of the bike with dual channel abs and we were not getting it till the end of 2017, they have launched it just now in the market. ABS is really important in the bike, with the kind of roads in india and people,  you definitely need abs in the bike, that is the only reason i m not giving full stars. I am a happy customer,  tvs service has been good. I hope this suggestion helps anyone who wants to buy this bike... Good luck :D"

TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,A value for money proposition ,3,Given the fact I have ridden the vehicle for quite some time now I feel the engine is very punchy across the rev band however i don't under why the tachometer is market until 12000 rpm given the fact it produces its peek power at just 8000 rpm which is actually very good as you don't need to redline the engine the engine will stay very healthy and the performance will also keep you happy for the amount its will cost you with the slipper clutch initially being hesitant but working seamlessly after say 700 kms and the gear shift being very smooth. dual channel ABS take absolute control of the vehicle giving you immense stopping power and making.

The power is mainly focused at the low and bottom end, the amazing digital instrument cluster and the dual-channel ABS made a better case for me.

TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Great bike go for it,5,"We have the 2006 first model, still running great with very good mileage and power. Drove 150000+ KMS, the built quality is very good in fact I have a Yamaha Fazer, the plastic quality of TVS Star City is better and thicker than Yamaha Fazer and also Honda Livo which my cousin has. Our bike was very badly maintained and in these 15 years time we had fully serviced the bike only 3 times, yes you read it right only 3 times. We didn't change the oil for 5 years (due to lack of awareness) because of which the mileage dropped, clutch plates damaged and a little wear and tear but now we change the oil after every 3000 KMS and now it is running smoothly with good mileage. The exhaust note is superb but the new TVS Star City Plus exhaust note is not that good. Top speed is around 75-80 KMPH but the new model is powerful and definitely can reach the ton. Rear suspension is not good we have changed it twice (but then there is our mistake too we didn't oil the suspensions at all and the suspension in the new model is good I think), once changed the clutch plate, twice changed the rear sprocket, the headlight isn't good (don't know about the new model), and indicator quality is not that good. No morning start problem with right tuning. vibration is there only at the top end and in normal speed, it is very smooth. no rattling, the high-speed stability could have been better but it is a totally city-focused bike in which it excels. And that's it, no major problems till now like the other bikes. This bike is very good for city use. Brakes are average, reliability is good and I cannot expect much from a second-hand bike as I bought it for Rs. 17000 only and maintained very badly and ridden harshly. It is one bike for lifetime. Thank you TVS for a quality product. If I will buy a new bike that will definitely be TVS as TVS has earned my trust. If you are looking for a city commuter with stylish looks, great mileage, good power and fun to ride with good pick-up then go for it and you will be happy."

TVS Sport,4.3,REALLY SPORT ( like Hima das) ,4,My review for my bike TVS Sport:-
TVS Sport,4.3,Simply Can’t Ask For More At This Price,5,"I purchased the TVS Sport in 2015 and over the course of 5 years, this machine has never failed or disappointed me. The major reason behind going for the TVS Sport was its fuel efficiency, and I have always got a mileage of over 65 km/l from this 100cc workhorse. While almost the whole motorcycle cycle is plastic, the parts are durable and long-lasting. The only part that ever broke down was the chain cover. Since it also made of plastic, a screw went down and the cover was cut due to coming in contact with the rear wheel. The replacement cost ₹ 450 the bike is just as fine as it was on day one."

Fuel efficiency is very nice but due to the first service, it burns a little bit more fuel. The company claims 95 km/l. But for my review, it gives 75+ of mileage. I loved the bike, the look. The blue color is stunning. Today is its first service, hope all the problem which I faced will go away. I recommend this bike to one who wants mileage and has a low budget.

Initially riding was good but afer 1yr bike start thrilling 2 time service complaint at authrised dealer bt no solution.Bike lock speed wire and self start get damage in 9 month. I repair them by paying bakwaas bike
TVS Sport,4.3,Not purchase tvs sports,3,Tvs sport good bike not exllient. 
TVS Sport,4.3,Disappointing Experience with the outcome. ,3,I have purchased TVS SPORTS ES BSIV model in November 2017. That blue coloured bike looks very impressive I must say that.  But the look is only good thing about the bike. The drawbacks are as follows. ..
TVS Sport,4.3,Experience with TVS not very well. ,3,TVS Suport is my third new bike. With this bike my experience is very bad. On the day of purchasing this bike am faced one problem of gear leaver hanging with this bike. I am never thinking about any problem in just new bike. After about this mileage is less than company commitment. During riding bike blasting from silencer. 
TVS Sport,4.3,TVS SPORT VERY POOR PICK AND PERFORMANCE,1,"I purchased TVS Sport in the year 2012 on the recommendation of TVS Service Centre mechanic. When I told him about changing my TVS Star City because it was 6 years old and started giving trouble. But after riding for a few months, It gave me disappointment only for its poor pick up and a year or two, the engine gets off while in running condition. I am not at all satisfied with TVS SPORT"
TVS Sport,4.3,Change the side stand..,4,Bike ka side stand jo hai ye sahi nhi hai bhut chota kache (mud) me ye dhass jaata hai ise thoda or chodai bhada do or driver ki left vali jo footres hai vo lambai me badi hai to bike niche lag jati hai plz is me change kare

Looks are great, mileage is 70+ (I have already tested at 60kmph inside city) , engine smoothness is butter like. The on If you want a bike that is total paisa-vasool, then this is the one for you. Without any second thoughts, go and buy this one. Looks are great, mileage is 70+ (I have already tested at 60kmph inside city) , engine smoothness is butter like. The only thing that I am unsatisfied about is the rear brake is loose, maybe that was from the beginning. The mechanic can fix it for you for Rs.10. Styling, comfort, economy, pickup, handling. All A1. It may be only 100 cc bike but then it is better than that camel bike called CD Deluxe and way better than the Passion. When you put the bike in 2nd gear and press the throttle, you can feel the engine rev up. And from 3rd gear you can take the bike till 60kmph. Awesome pickup. Reach 60 kmph within 8 seconds. I drove the bike at 85kmph while my brother says he took it till 100kmph."
TVS Sport,4.3,Great Mileage!!,5,"This is good bike when compared to Honda Dream Yuga , Hero Splendor , Bajaj Discover and Hero Passion Pro. Broad rear tires gives you good Handling and Control.

TVS Sport,4.3,My best Bike,5,"First of all I got this bike as a gift from my uncle, then I thought that its not a good bike as it is a economy class bike.... But when I used it I felt I was wrong .. It gives pretty impressive millage about 70 to 75......   Acceleration is also good but not the best U can only get this much in such price... If u will drive it in proper way then it will give about 80 millage. I like its design and color availability. Mine is white with blazing red, it looks superb . And u can trust TVS company as it is an Indian company . Mine has not given any problems yet and u can easily find a service center in every city . I love my bike as it helped me a lot. Merits- Better Millage , Better durability , Better Performance , Better light , Nice colour options , Better price ,     Demerits - Acceleration is slow , Makes noise , Not comfortable while driving for long period , Less power only 100cc . In short its a better option for those who are millage conscious. Thanks"
TVS Sport,4.3,a very high class bike with a cheapest price,4,i am using this bike  from 7-8 months. it is a very classy bike as compared to its price point. the only problem of this bike is of its sound. it makes an unpleasant sounds at high speed.  but as it is a 100 cc bike it goes to much high speed as compared bajaj platina and hero deluxe. i have reached a speed of 95km/hr with this bike. the mileage is fabulous. overall i am very happy with this bike and suggest other buyers to buy this bike as it is a cheapest bike now a days with a sporty and dashing looks.
TVS Sport,4.3,Worst Mileage,1,"TVS Sport is one of the awesome bikes in the lower category. This bike is loaded with features that a common man needs....from last 1 year of purchase, I found the average is very poor approx 51 to 55 km/l. Not satisfied with the mileage of the bike."
TVS Sport,4.3,Nice Performance with style & mileage...,4,"I'm using white-red color SPORT last 1yr 4month. It having nice handling at corners, comfortable suspension, new styling look & grate mileage in city with around 65 to 69km/l. It's new stunning look is very nice. But little bit it's break is not effective, I'm sending this problem to TVS state seller, he said ""one of the lot having low level break pad, which change now by the company."" Overall its superb Indian made bike..."
TVS Sport,4.3,super bike some improvements required,5,"super bike i am using from past 5years ,daily i will travel 90 kms ,  i am normaly going with 70 to 95 kms speed in this bike mileage also good up to 85kms , low maintanance cost ,pick up time is very low in this bike."
TVS Sport,4.3,dont take tvs bikes.......,2,it is the worst ever 
TVS Sport,4.3,Got wot i needed........,4,"accept the less gear speed ratio (which is the problem of every 100cc bike) and little noisy engine, this bike is good as per its specification, I owned one for 2 months, gear shift is smooth, better ride quality, it get shaky little bit above 70km/hr. but it reaches 92 km/hr in 14 secs, thats the max speed. Very happy with the mileage of 62km/lit as my average speed is on highway is always above 60km/hr. pickup is good; beside's this is third tvs product in my home after tvs champ and tvs scooty and so far now i have no regerts."
TVS Sport,4.3,Service issues with TVS Sport,3,"I am a businessman from Mumbai. I am passionate about cars and I own a few of them. I have a BMW X5, an Audi A6, a Range Rover Evoque and a Mercedes convertible. My servant used a Hero cycle to get vegetables for me from the market, he used to get really tired, so I decided to buy him a motorcycle. As I have never driven a motorcycle, I don’t have much knowledge about it. Since I am a big cricket fan and follow Virat Kohli, I decided to buy a TVS Sport for my servant because Kohli is the brand ambassador of it. After six months, my servant started complaining that the bike punctures a lot and the chain makes a lot of noise. According to what he told me, the fuel economy is good and the bike is very comfortable for riding in city but the maintenance cost is a bit too high. The bike needs service every couple of months and that is a bit frustrating because the bike is needed for work daily. I suggest that you should not buy a bike by only looking at the advertisements."
TVS Sport,4.3,"Value for money, fuel efficient",5,"TVS Motors thank you designing such an amazing motorcycle: TVS Sport. It is the most fuel efficient bike I have ever had, it returns me a mileage of above 60kmpl. The engine is smooth and complements the lightweight and makes the pick up just better than expectations. It has been over 2 years that I own this special bike and think I will cherish it for next few years as there is no big problem I have encountered with it. The battery seems to be down though and the tyres have lost its grip but I think that’s because of my long and frequent rides with my friends. "

Now it delivers mileage of 45-50 kmpl in city. Within the period of using I have come across some serious issue related to performance and  various parts of this bike. Before describing its issue, show you the positive side of this bike. The bike got attractive looks, Noise free engine, very comfortable seats, and the handling characteristics are awesome. The bike has very light in weight that makes it easy to handle. "

I am here to share my reviews about TVS sport so that this review might be helpful for anyone. The looks are stunning and eye catchy. The engine is redefined and puts mileage of 68 kmpl highways and 62 kmpl in city. But the problem is with gearbox, the 1st and 2nd gear got stuck sometimes. I have told to service personnel's about this problem but did not get a reliable solution. The maintenance cost is very reasonable. "

TVS Sport,4.3,good bike with great milege(Tvs Sport),4,"TVS Sport gets most of its styling bits from its elder sibling Star city. It has a very compact design and looks sporty. The clear lens headlight with a tinted visor looks very stylish and doesn't look as flat as others like Bajaj Patina and Hero Splendor. TVS has used the all black colour theme on this bike with black silencer, engine and alloy wheels. New stylish graphics enhance the visual appearance of this bike. It uses orange coloured side indicators which complements the bike really well but should have been flexible. Rear profile also looks very compact with small, clear lens tail light, black coloured grab rail and short mudguard. Visually you can notice the extended length of its seat which covers some of the part of its fuel tank which has a fuel capacity of 12 litres."

The expanding drum brakes works excellently in any conditions and keep the bike in safety.TVS Sport has a well designed handle, alloy wheels, broad tyres, streamlined body and a shoe-type seat that adds to the comfortable ride. The rear and front suspensions work well and help in realizing the maximum comfort level in this bike. It is an affordable bike in its price range.

TVS Sport,4.3,is it a gud bike?,2,"hello guys, i am from kolkata. I own a tvs sport white green in colour. I have covered almost 4000 kms with this bike but i would say this not a bike up to the mark. It had past only 10 months of my buying the bike but its battery got damaged, my cluth wire got damaged i changed 2 times but the result is same. The worst part of the bike is its sound. The sound of this is no unpleasent that i cant anything. It has vibrations at speed above 40. I admire its mileage which is adorable. It gives a mileage of about 70-80 kmpl which is quite impressive. The balance of this bike is medium i.e not so good not so bad. The rear tyres are worst. It  slips very badly in wet road. Finally i would suggest other buyers not to buy this bike whether u get it at a low price. It is a horrible bike. Thanks everyone.."

I have already made a complaint to TVS Dealership on every service I have done my 4 service already and V is pending but they are not able to sort out my problem even they are not able to set the mileage on 70 to 80 kilometres per litre.

If you are looking for something that can be your companion for your office commutes, the TVS Sport is a perfect package for the purpose."
TVS Sport,4.3,Pamper It Or It Will Fall Off,5,"The TVS Sport is a fine motorcycle for the price that is asks for. Besides, everything is plastic and eager to rattle unless you take good care of it. It needs to be serviced at every 2,500km to 3,000km in order to stay in shape. If you are considering getting one, be ready to treat it like a fragile commodity."

TVS Sport,4.3,70+ KMPL Is Actually Achievable - TVS Sport ,5,"TVS markets the Sport has a highly fuel-efficient motorcycle and that is true as well. However, you need to ride this bike the way it is supposed to get the best out of it. I own a TVS Sport from August 2018 and have got up to 75 km/l from this bike. But if you ride likes you will ride an Apache or a Pulsar, the mileage drops down to 50-55 km/l. Ride smooth at around 40-50 km/h and the TVS Sport will surely return a mileage of over 70 km/l."
TVS Sport,4.3,Very fuel-efficient - TVS Sport,5,"I was looking for a bike that could easily return 50+ kmpl of fuel economy, and I went for TVS Sport because it not only looks sporty but performs flawlessly as well.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Colours Are Best But Too Costly ,3,"Jupiter is the best scooter but prices are too high. No new features, same models, high prices. You attract customers by colours and not by models, due to this customers are not satisfied."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Mileage is good,4,I am using a TVS Jupiter Scooty for the past about 1 year.  Engine performance and gearbox everything is very good. The best scooter I have come across. I feel no back pain while riding a scooter. It's riding on potholes and speed breaker is never a hassle with this scooter as it floats when it crosses one. Mileage is good.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Vibration at 40 speed,3,"Pros: 12 inch wheels, fuel open/close system, front left storage. the easy center stands and kick start. Cons: TVS Jupiter makes rubbing noise during transmission between 35- 45 kmph. Other 10% may happen inside but we don't know. The paint looks very nice but glossy paint comes with poor quality. If you rub, a clear coat will fade. Have personal experience and common research to say Jupiter is smooth till 35 kmph and after 50 kmph."

I used it for travel from my office to home daily and I haven't fac any major problem till date. Moreover it looks quite heavy which suits my personality. I would definitely recommend it to everyone who are looking for a good scooter. 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter Review,5,"I must start with the buying experience, I wanted to buy using cc but there was an extra charge for the cc payment, so I managed to buy by paying most of the amount in cash. Pros: 12 inch wheels, fuel open/close system, front left storage. the easy center stands and kick start. Cons: TVS Jupiter makes rubbing noise during transmission between 35- 45 kmph."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter Review,5, love TVS Jupiter
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,It's very bad experience for me. New scooter stopped in road. Start button also not working. So it's very difficult situation for me to start it by using kick. Digital meter not working while I put 500 rs petrol in it. Front light is also not working from 8 days when I purchased brand new scooter. I recommend please do not purchase this scooter. It willwaste your money as well as time.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter Review,5,TVS Jupiter - Average is the demon  Suspension and pickup of TVS Jupiter is very good but when it comes to average its very low. Rest everything is superb. Comfortable for rides and under seat space is bigger than any other scooter present in the market. Petrol tank of this scooty is also in good place and its looks very beautiful also. New cpolours are good but TVS should improve their fuel efficiency or mileage. Servicing of TVS is also not satisfying.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter My Experience ,5,I have a very great experience with my TVS Jupiter scooty because when I ride it I feel very safe and secure. Maintenanace cost of it is very low and it gives very good mileage in the city also. Its lights and tyre sysems are like cherry on the cake. I think if anyone is thinking to buy a new scooter I will suggest to go for TVS Jupiter instead of Activa or Maestro.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,Great Indian Scooter - I bought this scooter after many test rides of activa and Jupiter. The main advantages you will get in Jupiter while comparing to Activa are that it feels very light while riding. Acceleration of Jupiter is very fast as compared to Activa. It comes with very smooth engine and it got disc brakes which are not available in Activa. Both wheels have the same size of alloy. I have ridden it for almost 500 km and got a mileage 42 which I think is very good before first service.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,"TVS Jupiter Ranks Number 1 - I'm the owner os Jupiter from last twon years and I will definetly say that this scooter is the kning of all scooters. I have previously used Honda Activa then switched to Jupiter and the reasons for which I switched were its design, comfort and fuel capaciy. I'm fully satisfied with my scooter. Scooter is loaded with many features but diamond cut look makkes it best."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Worst in the market ,3,First of all don't beleive on the mileage which is shown in the ad. Its maximum mileage is 40 kmpl. Please have test ride before buying it with minimum quantity of fuel so that you can get idea of mileage. Moreover this scooty will give you a lot of trouble after 6-7 months. I would recommend everyone to not buy this scooter as per my experience this is the worst scooter present in the market.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,"TVS - Brand We Can Trust - I must say Jupiter is the comfortable scooty present in the market as I have ridden Activa, Maestro, Duet and Wego but this scooty is very comfortable. Jupiter is also very safe scooter and mileage is also quite decent. While other scooters service are costly and service centres takes time but this is not the scenario in TVS service centre. They openly welcomes us and didn't take any extra time in serviving. I'm very satusfued with my both riding experience and service centre experience."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter Review,5,Powerful Scooter - TVS Jupiter - TVS Jupiter comes with powerful 110 cc engine with 8.4 Nm torque which helps this scooter in giving powerful perfrormance. It comes with tubelss tyres and disc brakes which enhances its performance. This scooter is suitable for both boys and girls. Looks very stylish and different from other scooters available in the market. Moreover you can always trust the performance of the TVS products. Very excellent scooter. Worth to buy.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,TVS Jupiter parts not good - The main problem that you will face in this scooter is its parts and build quality is not good at all. Moreover it requires servicing at very frequent intervals. Mileage of this scooter is also very low which will be a buden for evryone. The quality of service and the behaviour of the TVS staff after sales is also not good. Overall not a worth to buy this scooter. You can look for other scooters in the market.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,TVS Jupiter- Average Scooter - According to me there is not much difference between Jupiter and other petrol scooters available in the market. One pro is that its seat is quite comfortable whih other scooters lack. Other then that this scooter is just an average scooter. Mileage of this scooter is also not very good. Moreover service provided by the TVS agency is very bad and behaviour of the staff members are also very bad. Its just an average scooter nothing more. Other options available in the market are also good. There is tough competition.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter - Very Comfortable ,5,I must say one thing about this scooter is that this scooter is way too much comfortable while riding it. You will not feel back pain and it runs very smooth on busy roads also. Pickup of this scooter is very good as compared to other scooter in the market. Mileage of this scooter is also very good. Very low cost maintenance. This scooter is suitable for both men and women. Anyone can use it for daily use. I am very happy to have it.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,"TVS Jupiter - Best In The Business - According to my experience this scooter is the best scooter as compared to other scooters. It comes with TVS intelliGo technology, which turns off the engine while idling for a long time in traffic. The scooter also comes with an all-in-one ignition key slot for extra convenience. It also gets a large 21-litre underseat storage compartment and a sizable 2-litre cubbyhole on the back of the apron as well as mobile phone charging. Moreover its mileage is just amazing. Very comfortable to ride. Very low cost maintenance. Good choice for both boys and girls."

The bike is rev-friendly and the ABS is a blessing. I actually wanted to buy the RTR 200 4V but the split seat setup is something I am not fond of. The TVS RTR 180 ABS can’t be compared to the RTR 200 4V, but it is equally fun to ride and stays firm at even 100+ kmph. The maintenance costs are also pocket-friendly. However, the mileage of 40 kmpl hurts at times."

There are no rattles, the engine is still smooth, and the performance hasn’t dropped a bit. It still flies like it did on day one. I might soon get an RTR 200 4V as well. Hopefully, the newer TVS models are just as good."
TVS Apache RTR 180,4.5,In Love With The RTR 180 - TVS Apache RTR 180,5,"I bought a TVS RTR 180 in August 2018 following a thorough research and numerous test rides of various bikes in the segment.

TVS Apache RTR 180,4.5,Dual Channe ABS is A Life Saver,5,"TVS has been offering dual-channel ABS on the RTR 180 from the very beginning, even before it became a norm. And, the ABS unit on this is simply a true life-saver. I was riding back home at around 11 PM at night on a road without any road lights. Suddenly, a pack of dogs came out of nowhere and I had to pull the brakes as hard as possible, moreover, the road wasn’t of great quality either but the ABS system did not allow the wheels to lock and I was able to come to a halt without falling down. This bike is a keeper."

TVS Apache RTR 180,4.5,"Awesome, best in Class.Go for IT- TVS Apache RTR 180",5,"I have Apache 180 before I bought Apache 160. I would say this is the best bike in this budget and well ahead of the competition in performance. It's very powerful, awesome looks, great handling and the best thing about this bike is the exhaust note. The bike is purely made to cater to the needs of bikers with less budget but wants to enjoy racing DNA. Just go for it. The top speed which I have driven is 125KMPL. But it goes about 133 KMPL. Only one disadvantage of this bike is the vibration at high speeds."
TVS Apache RTR 180,4.5,Amazing Bike - TVS Apache RTR 180 ,5,"I can’t praise TVS for making a bike like the RTR 180. Moreover, while other manufacturers were busy making huge profits and doing cost-cutting, TVS has offered the bike with a dual-channel ABS from the very beginning. On my way back home from our village, a wild pig came in my way on the highway when I was cruising at 110 kmph. That’s when the dual-channel ABS came into action and saved me from a crash."

I am in love with my Apache 180 RTR & if I am going to buy another one rest assured it will be an apache. "

So you can judge it by yourself.
TVS Apache RTR 180,4.5,"Perfect Combination of Power, Style, Mileage ",4,"I bought my Apache RTR 160 in December, 2010. I just love the first feel I got after sitting on this bike. I also took ride on other bikes but it was completely different experience. The handling of bike is perfect, I never feel back pain as I ride my bike daily about 15 km. Yeah, the tire grip is not satisfactory on wet roads. Brakes are also good but rear shock absorbers give bad sound when it gets to a big ditch. It’s a bouquet of power, style, mileage and comfort. According to me Apache has got the toughest body, compared to Yamaha FZ. Handling wise it offers a good feel and shocks are quite responsive and make the ride enjoyable and happy. Engine sound is normal compared to all other 150cc four stroke bikes. The front brake is amazing but rear disc is little hard. If we apply both at the same time than it works great. Look wise it is quite different from all other bike, eye catching parking lights, clear head light and smooth finished indicators."

Thank you.."
TVS Apache RTR 180,4.5,The Prodigal Son ,4,"Excellent bike with adequate 17 bhp of power, i think its more than enough for a normal city commute, maintenance is pretty cheap as it is TVS. Yes i do agree with the vibration issue with this bike being more substantial, but in those 4 years with this bike i really didn't mind it still had the beans and was on par with other sub 200 cc bikes. Higher revs after 10000 rpm are useless buts its power delivery is more than linear upto 10000 rpm which i feel is really good. I'd suggest people to buy with ABS as the brakes are pretty much ok. The mileage is also pretty decent 30-35kmpl. The TVS tires frankly spoil the handling of this bike if at all you wanna change your tires i'd suggest Michelin pilot sport they are really good and help the bike to handle far better. There are compromises in every bike but before buying take a test drive understand your needs well and buy. Last but not the least i am actually fed up of TVS service so i have started servicing my own bike, its better.        "

No other bike can attain 130 KMPH in this segment, but the built quality is very poor. i have faced some unusual issues with my bike, which clearly shows the poor built quality. The low range torque is bit lesser but once it crosses 4000 RPM, it pulls like anything. It gives you wings at 6000 RPM. The best part of Apache RTR is the breaking,  the response is awesome. even in 90's (speed) it stops at a single stroke. It gives a very good fuel economy at 45 KMPL. One more best part is the design, not too busy or very faded, nice tank scoops, belly pan, a very good visor which gives you wind protection at 100 KMPH also. With minor negatives (can be negligible) it is the best 160 CC bike.   "

There are no vibration issues on this machine. Also, it delivers good mileage. I don't notice any issues with the bike yet it has been a month now since I bought it. The LEW headlights are quite good and the upper beam helps you to see the heavy vehicle from a distance and talk about the breakings the ABS does the job exceptionally, but you have to keep in mind that using the rear brake directly may cause your bike to skid as it comes with the front ABS. You should use the front brake first. Overall the bike is quiet satisfactory, there is no other bike in this segment that handles all segments."
