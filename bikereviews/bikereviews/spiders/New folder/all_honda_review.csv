Honda Livo,4.2,Good Commuter Bike,4,"Honda Livo is a best-in-class commuter bike. It's slightly expensive compared to similar price range commuters offered by other manufacturers like Hero Passion Pro, Bajaj CT 100 and Hero Splendor series. However, comfort and convenience this bike gives is at different level and other bikes can't compete at such price range. Some people would opt for Honda Shine 125 because it is in same price range and offers 125cc engine. But if you are mileage conscious then you should consider buying Honda Livo.

Honda XBlade,4.1,Best Bike Ever.,5,What can I say about X-Blade.
Honda XBlade,4.1,From FZ V3 I Switched to Xblade,4,"I almost thought of taking FZ V3, after riding both the bikes I changed my mind to honda, engine smoothness & refinement is great. Xblade came up with great looks & BS 6 Fi engine of 163cc which wins over Yamaha.

Honda XBlade,4.1,Beautiful Bike,4,It's an amazing bike with a comfortable seat. Its mileage is superb and the front look is beautiful.
Honda XBlade,4.1,Disadvantage Of The Bike,4,"First thing lightings are worst. When it comes to the highway or one way while yellow light bikes opposite vehicle's passes, mean our white lights won't be visible. I feel halogen lights are better for this XBlade instead of LED lights. 2nd disadvantage is seat cushions are like a wood plate. Body full of fibre easy to break and fade. On potholed roads, we can get each body part's vibration. Front tyres are very thin like Splendor bikes so braking is worst. The next thing side stand is not sufficient to carry 140kgs of bike weight. Plastic button locks one lock is broken means need to change that whole part. The button locks will expand the gaps of each body's fitments. Metal body means we can have the same fitment gaps till the end of bike life. Plastic moulded fibre tank. The fork is very weak and thinner like the Splendor bike. "
Honda XBlade,4.1,Worth Buying,4,"My x-blade bs6 double-disc deluxe (black color) have just completed 3,001 km . I ride through highway town as well as village non metal roads absolutely on regular basis. Till date I didn't face any trouble by any means. Engine performs as per, suspension system is awesome, riding posture is like a Perfect Commuter and mileage is varying from 44-53km/l(according to my travel) Honda X Blade bs6 has the most power-packed, versatile engine in its category. Worth buying."
Honda XBlade,4.1,Excellent Bike,4,"A great bike for everything, comfort, mileage, looks, and more. A nice silent start is a very nice thing that I personally like. Honda serves us very well. Pick-up is great. Also, the full digital meter it gives you looks nice and the live averaging is the best I've ever seen. My personal advice is to buy this."
Honda XBlade,4.1,Bike Is Overall A Budget Performer,4,The bike is overall a budget fit and performance equipped in its category and stands fit in competition. A little improvement needs in aesthetics as the headlamp appears a little bit elongated which does not look bad. The rest of the things are fine. Japanese engine is best in its peak performance.
Honda XBlade,4.1,Honda X-Blade is a decent bike,5,"Honda X Blade offers good engine performance and excellent features. The starting price range is 1.15lacs approx, which seems affordable in terms of engine and fantastic fit and finish just simply adds to its definition."

Honda CD 110 Dream,3.9,Awesome Bike,4,"I purchased CD 110 DLX in November 2020. The bike is awesome for average-budget people and for good mileage. Now, Splendor Plus is overpriced according to CD110, having good features than Splendor Plus. My overall suggestion is to go for this."

Honda Gold Wing,4.8,awasome,5,"A versatile bike that suits all needs in my opinion. I would definitely recommend anyone to get this bike, perfect for new and old riders. I particularly like the riding posture of the bike, the seat is nice and big meaning you can sit upright, or sit farther away for a more racing position. The engine is smooth and has a lovely upper powerband, although can pull easily in any gear. Nice sounding engine in the higher rev's, although can be a little quiet when cruising, which isn't always a bad thing. If I had to pick a fault it would be a tiny vibration at 2500 RPM, sounds like it's just a vibrating panel near the dash assembly. Although who rev's it that slow!"
Honda Gold Wing,4.8,Amazing bike.,4,Honda Gold wing is a super stylish bike and the power which is unbeatable for safety purposes. I prefer Goldwing and if we talk about mileage and maintenance that do not bed as performance if you want performance like Gold wing then you need to spent this little more. 
Honda CB350RS,4.0,Good Bike In This Segment,4,"Performance-wise this is a very good bike, engine refinement and mileage are also good. It comes with great features and its performance is just amazing. It's a lot better than other bikes in this segment. "
Honda Gold Wing,4.8,Good bike ,5,"The bike is extremely comfortable and I feel that the gold wing just glides in the road like a king. But when compared with the BMW 1600k grand America is better than Honda gold wing in terms of comfort. Otherwise, the gold wing is a very good bike."
Honda Gold Wing,4.8,Best in class.,5,The styling of the bike is amazing I am very much interested in this bike. 
Honda CB350RS,4.0,Really Good Machine,4,"I have been taking notes on my CB 350 RS for the past few months and I have to say, this is a really good machine that any younger anywhere in the world would love to have. For a Solo riding experience, this one offers an awesome experience due to its specially made seat. I won't say the same about the pillion seat though. The mileage returns on the bike look pleasing enough for a 350cc category and compared to the competition, it is far better. As Honda has already specified, the looks are targeted toward the younger audience, and yeah, the whole bike gets me excited the moment I see it. It has a powerful engine and is really great in its mid-range though it lacks a bit of torque compared to the rivals like the Royal Enfields. Its slightly aggressive stance also makes the bike engaging enough that you would never really get bored of it. If there is a drawback to this machine, it's got to be how dirty it gets. And not to be exaggerating, but this is a seriously bad drawback unless you decide to add some aftermarket fenders or huggers. Other than that, every other aspect of this machine is just so eco-friendly and well, this is a Honda. So, I would definitely recommend this machine to anyone who wants a nice and engaging but relaxed ride on our Indian pothole-ridden roads. "
Honda CB350RS,4.0,Honda CB350 RS is my love,4,"I’m so in love with my Honda CB350 RS as it has such nice and thrilling features.

Plus, it is extremely affordable when I see all the features offered.,"
Honda CB350RS,4.0,Personal Review ,4,"The Honda CB350RS is a stylish and sporty motorcycle that offers a good balance between performance and comfort. It is an ideal choice for riders like me who are looking for a modern classic with a more aggressive design. The engine delivers sufficient power for daily commuting and occasional highway rides, while the handling and riding experience makes it enjoyable for me to ride in various conditions. The inclusion of features such as LED lighting and a semi-digital instrument cluster adds to its overall appeal. Overall, the CB350RS is a worthy addition to Honda's lineup and a strong competitor in the 350cc segment."
Honda CB350RS,4.0,Best In Segment,4,"Best in its segment, the engine performance is outstanding. However, the maintenance cost is slightly high. The styling is super and overall, it provides great value for money."

Honda SP 125,4.2,Reliable Choice,4,"A very good and reliable bike for daily commutes. Build quality is good, though not the best as compared to its BS4 variants. Rear wheel size and rear footrests are the worst in the 125 cc segment and for the price Honda charges. Have been riding for the last 3 years and clocked 42k km so far with an average of 73kmpl with 70% highways and 30% city rides. So far no change in the chain sprocket, nor the rear brake liner. All in all the bike is a good buy if our riding style is decent and when services are done at 5k intervals as suggested by Honda."

Honda SP 125,4.2,Practical And Reliable Bike,4,"The Honda SP 125 is a no-nonsense commuter that gives decent overall performance and the right gasoline performance. The overall comfort is decent too. However, the design of the motorcycle is conservative and the pricing is pretty excessive, which doesn’t make it a budget-friendly motorbike. The 125cc engine delivers adequate electricity for everyday commuting and is delicate, offering easy acceleration.

However, the motorcycle's very conservative appearance and expensive price point prevent it from being a good value for money. A fantastic bike in every way, including comfort, mileage, style, and more. I personally find a good quiet start to be a really wonderful thing. Honda is a great help to us. The pickup is excellent. Additionally, the live averaging is the greatest I've ever seen, and the complete digital meter it provides you with looks excellent. Purchase this bike, in my opinion."

Honda Activa 125,4.2,Not A Good Vehicle,3,"Honda Activa 125 gives very bad mileage in the city. It gives 30-35kmpl of mileage in the city and 35-40 on the highway.

For women, it is heavier to handle."

I am very happy with the riding solace and features. The Silent start and an engaging sound when contrasted with past versions.Pros: 1.) Agreeable Start2.) Agreeable ride3.) Wonderful looks: 1.) The under-seat stockpiling is opened with a press button in the front combined with the Bike key. This occasionally could prompt neglect of the key after shutting the seat down.2.) Standing by Stop Framework: This component is great on streets with high traffic stops. In any case, a risk looms when at home or stopping. We get back home or park someplace to visit and so forth, and the Motor stops in 3 seconds. That is fine. Yet, if somebody while talking or pausing, unexpectedly plays with the Gas pedal accepting the Motor being off would prompt more noteworthy mishaps."

Honda Shine,4.0,Poor Bike,1,Honda CB shine liya aur ghar chala gya fir agle din 30/6/2020 barish ke karn me ghar par hi tha. Fir agle din 1/7/2020 ko me gaadi le kar nikla ghar se aur meri new Honda CB Shine gaadi problem karni chaalu ho gayi meri gaadi me 2 prakar ki samasya hai. Handel se bahot aawaj aur gayer ka bar bar fashna mene gaadi (grand Honda lodhi para chaok pandri Raipur) se kharidi hai  mene showroom se baat ki to meri problem sunne ko koyi bhi raazi nahi hai  ulta mujhe dhamki de rahe hai ki gaadi bhi rakh lenge. Aur mera payment bhi nahi denge ab me kya karu kaam me aane jaane ko mayne.
Honda Shine,4.0,Awesome Experience With This Bike,3,"The main problem with this bike is its gearbox. Gear ratios are not well fixed and will have to downshift to pull it in high gear low-speed scenarios in order to get a quick overtake. Acceleration is good in 0 to 55 or so looses out power past this and the engine is stressed. Engin is refined though it vibrates past 60 km but still better than any other commuter in this segment. I touched 100 km on this bike. Suspensions are well set and its quite comfortable with an average-sized co-rider but the heavier load on the bike will surely. Fuel efficiency is good if sensibly ridden. A headlamp is dull and really doesn't help very much at night. I installed fog lamps separately. Riding dynamic is good. Comfortable seat adds up to riding comfort for day to day commute or long rides. Overall if you are basically a commuter and still enjoy a little push on your daily commute, go for it without a doubt."

Honda Activa 6G,4.3,Best Scooter.,3,"This is a nice scooter, its performance is best only issue is it has small tires."
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,"Best scooter.,",5,My first experience with Honda Activa was in 2006 and it was a very special day for our family when you came to our pavilion you just made our life with bright and luck.  it was like a soft cushion with light-weight and heavy controlling hands.
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,Great scooter.,5,"I know that the price of Activa 6G will increase due to BS6, but I hope it will not be above 10k. I have been wanting to buy a new scooter for a while now but thought I would wait for the new BS6 Activa. The new fuel injected system should give it a smoother throttle response. I hope Honda adds some new features that will justify the price increase, some new color options will be good too. What will add the cherry on the cake is if they add disc brake at the front. "
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,Nice Scooter.,5,"The Activa has always been one of the best scooters around, the only issue is that it was not youth-friendly. Meaning that it feels like a scooter for the older generation. I hope with the new 6G (or whatever they call it), they will add something that will appeal to the youth more. Maybe some new graphics or paintwork would do the trick. I know Honda already has the Dio which is kind of youth-oriented but it is very uncomfortable to ride. Let's hope for some good upgrades with the new Activa 6G."
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,Improved Safety featured bike.,5,"There has been a lot of speculation about the new Activa 6G, we all know that it will be BS6 ready. One thing I really hope they add is a disc brake at the front. One of the weakest points of the Activa has always been the brakes in my years of owning several of them. This will be a great addition and will make a great scooter even better. "
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,Best Scooter.,5,"We have always had Activas in our family for over a decade now. It always seems to be the 'go-to' scooter for everyone. One big change in the new one that is coming is that it will be fuel-injected. This should hopefully make Activa 6G more fuel-efficient, I hope! if not then at least it will be smoother to drive thanks to the new fueling system. The slightly more complex engine might increase repairs costs if something goes wrong. But I doubt that will happen, considering how reliable the Activa has proven to be."
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,The new masterpiece by Honda.,5,"The scooter world has been dominated by the Activa for years now and I fell  Honda has started to become lazy and let the success get to them. I hope with the new Activa 6G, they will add some new segment-first features to make the product even more compelling. I love Honda scooters, their engines are extremely refined and fuel-efficient but they need to add some features to compete with their rivals. I hope the new BS6 variant will see something different that will wow the consumers."

Honda CB300R,4.3,Honda will rule now!,5,Looking damn fantastic to own & ride!
Honda CB300R,4.3,Definitely not for India,2,"I have taken a test drive of this bike with a pillion as well as a pillion on typical Bangalore roads & had been waiting for this bike for a year to be launched in India. was inclined towards it because KTMs are now too abundant in India. Below is my opinion Engine is very cool and calm.  Definitely not as harsh as a KTM.  2 Excellent build quality everything looks premium. 3 very comfortable riding position and agile for solo riding.  I am 5'11"" & felt so comfortable while riding & very bad ground clearance. The softer suspension has also to be blamed here. 2 Pillion will have a hard time holding on for his life. forget about women, even men will have a hard time. Thanks to the tiny pillion seat. Though it looks big enough in pictures, the rider will occupy more than half of the place and pillion ends up sitting in the air. Grab rails provided are useless.  Due to the light weight of the machine, with a pillion rider, the front part becomes so weightless 4. Despite the price, the bike looks tiny and doesn't have the expected road presence.  Being called a premium naked Street bike doesn't just feel right for this machine. I've seen people canceling their bookings after test riding it. Everything else is good."

Honda CBR1000RR-R,4.8,Complete Package,4,"The bike is a complete head-turner and an attention grabber. The performance is great with good low-end, mid-range, and high-end performance. The seating position is a little aggressive. The brakes are awesome, the calipers work well paired with a big 330mm dual disc. Fuel economy is good 10 - 12 with a full system Akrapovic exhaust and BMC air filter. The gear shifting is good and slick. The tyres are just awesome. Electronics are everything you need, quick shifter works smoothly. Haven't tested the cruise control yet. The TFT display is awesome. Riding modes are there for each terrain and condition. ground clearance is good for the city. Overall a must-try bike if anyone has the budget. Honda's engines are gems (most reliable)."
