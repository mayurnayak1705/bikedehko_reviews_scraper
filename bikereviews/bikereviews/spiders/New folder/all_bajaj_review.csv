I will sugges you all to take this product becouse it is to ride and other features like milege and very easy to oprate the bike in this range i will say this is the best product Its design is just fab. The seat is pretty comfortable. It can be easily handled and controlled. Its not much heavy as well.The brakes are pretty decent too.The engine also is quite good. It gives mileage of 60kmpl. Bike is very good for daily commuting.  Only maintenance is a disadvantage. Best fuel efficient bike in this category.It is a Economical bike because its prize is very low.A fight till the end of petrol. Platina is 4 stroke bike and 100 cc engine. Platina is not good looking bike and not very comfortable.The look of this bike is not good. One of the best fuel efficient bikes that comes in budget which is under. A good thing about platina is we can rely on it in a long trip as it’s actually too comfortable for ridingIt has a good suspension
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Best in mileage,4,Bought it 5 years ago.
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Good bike platina,4,This is best bike ever  .of bajaj and this give the great average of the 85 km\g 
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bike with great mileage,2,"Bajaj is one of the valuable bike manufacturer  who build bike with  great mileage (80 Kmph).The price of the bike is lower compared to other bike in market. Never expect a great pulling from the 100 CC Platina. But even a single person can ride with comfortable.Service cost of the bike is less compared to other bikes of same manufacturer. You can trust Bajaj  Platina as you need a bike with good mileage. I need to change the speedometer and cables after 15,000 Kms. of running. Also need to change the Chain and Sprocket after 25,000 Kms of running. No other spare parts replacement come in my usage. The tyres come with alloy wheels. If you  use  bike   daily for going office or other work the bike never steal your pocket. If you are living in Hill area, I never suggest this bike for your use because its engine power is lower . The manufacturer focused mainly in mileage  and not in power.  The bike with Trailing arm with co- axial hydraulic shockabsorber is not so bad. It has 11L petrol tank."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,bajaj platina bike review,5,"I had used more than 8 to 10 bike  during different road conditions but the bajaj platina was top amongst all other bike because of fuel efficiency and load carrying capacity .The new Bajaj Platina ES comes equipped with a 102cc, four-stroke, single cylinder engine that is naturally cooled by air. The new motorcycle is equipped with a thumb-starter that does not require the clutch to be engaged when cranking, and does so with no fuss at all, to settle into a quiet idle.s model is known for its best design .The Platina ES is long and sleek in the flesh, with a refreshed front fascia that it largely carries forward from the regular Platina. But overall, the ES is almost completely redesigned. The bright red motorcycle provided to us looked smart in the flesh. Its front cowl is reworked to form a solid panel now - the black visor seen on the previous model has been dropped. Protected by the cowl is an old school, all-analogue instrument panel, displaying a speedometer, odometer and a fuel gauge via twin chrome-rimed meters. Handle grips are soft to touch and are of decent quality, so are the black levers. Mirrors work well to provide a broad view of the approaching traffic. The well-curved fuel-tank has a filler-cap hinge provided for convenience. Moving on, a long, flattish and dual-tone saddle is provided with a grippy seat-cover for the rider and pillion. Body-coloured grab handle make way here."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj Platina Review by experience,5,Engine type	Air cooled single cylinder
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,What a bike in these days. clearly money saver.,4,This bike is the bestest bike. I mean which bike can give milage like this one. When my father gifted me this bike on my 19 birthday i was full of surprise that time. That time i thought that this bike is not the best and it is ok for me but when i start riding on this bike i mean what a felling came even i can't mention. Wow this bike is the father of all bikes in milage.No tension of filling the fuel again and again. I remeber when my father and i often goes to amritsar on this bike we just fill our petrol tank with 1.5 litres of petrol and this bike does not need even 1.5 litres.When we return we often see about 0.5 litre of petrol left in the petrol tank.Now  a days petrol and diesel prices prices are rising day by day and with this bike you don't have any tension about petrol prices . Thankyou a and my main opinion for this bike is the mileage.
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj Platina-Review,5,I have purchased Bajaj Platina on November 2014. It is the best bike with great mileage and great comfort level. I am living in Ahmedabad and traffic is very much in my city. I have purchased it on EMI from nearby Dealer. Below are the pros and Cons of Bajaj Platina Bike.
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,satisfied with platina...,4,"i amreall satisfied with this bike.Bajaj Platina is a mileage bike with 96 kmp which is really commendable.t supports both self start and kick start both.ir is very much user friendly. Overall it is a good bike considering the price and can be a best choice for one who are looking for lightweight, easy to handle and a mileage bike."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,A Good Bike But It Depends.....,3,"My experience is that this is good if you are 1. maintaining it well (dont go on low maintainece cost as suggested by many like 1800 in four years). Timely oil change and servicing will do good. 2. In one hand - you share it with many guys and the result will be not far. I required engine work at 38000 km only, because I handed the keys to many guys over this period.   No doubt with guys on this forum who rode 60-70000 kms and happy because this is really good. Fuel wise very economical. In initial days, before 1st service, it was giving mileage around 90 kmpl. But very soon it comes around 60. after 2 servicing I say. I spent a lot of time, I remember, in bajaj service centre, arguing, why it cant give a mileage now what it was before, but to no avail. If you are lucky and maintaining it in true way, may be you can get 70 also.  :-( Disadvantage:- very light weight, I remember times, when I turned more than 90 degree when I applied sudden brakes. But again, you will not expect it to be behave like a sporty bike, so I close this point. After I purchased this bike, I rode a lot Hero bikes, Splendour and Passion. After that the general observation I make is that you should not go for a 100 cc bike first. Even if you go, take splendour. As I see, all bajaj bikes makes a kir-kir sound whereas the Hero bikes make a sound of drum. Pickup and silken touch of excellerator another good thing of Hero’s bikes and Brakes are also good. After a couple of years of bachelorhood spent  with this Platina, and after marriage also, as a normal office goer guy who also carries his wife on pillion riding, I would suggest go for a 125 cc not bajaj bike. Passion is a great bike. We saw a lot of 100 CC bikes but all are failed and wherever exist, gives a pity look. like CT-100, TVS-Victor etc, Platina has not met that fate, but you cant say for how long. Hero Honda earliest CD-100 SS was a good bike, but the remodelled CD100 looking small built like Yamaha was a big flop. Go for 125 cc bike, and that too not from Bajaj. Bajaj’s strength in market is due to Pulsar."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,good avg bike bajaj platina,4,"Dear Concern i am using bajaj platina 100 cc bike last 6 year and no dought it's performance is very good and cost effective,low maintenance high average bike for lower distance it's create problem when we going for travel long distance due to engine quality not so good as my expectation  but mileage is very good so that according to me at this price very good bike It gives a strong pick in third gear with a single rider while with two rider on 2nd gear. It also works with automatic transmission which can control the bike by simple acceleration and a brake. The rear and front drum brakes can bring the bike under perfect control in any riding mode. The bike gives a decent mileage of around 60 kmpl but can gain 75-80 kmpl by third service. Under standard test conditions of the manufacturer, it obtains 108 kmpl.The entry level bike Bajaj Platina 100cc was launched as the cheapest bike in its segment to compete with Hero Honda. Since its launch the bike has got popularity among the buyers both in India and outside due to its reduced cost and presentation. The bike has many executions like body panels, fairings, and electronics, similar to former Bajaj Wind 125. Platina 100cc has been in great demand by the customers for its gorgeous style, stunning performance, outstanding mileage and negligible expenses in its range. The bike attracts the youngsters giving them a suitable personal choice for their daily commute."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Best For workers,4,"suspension of the Platina is absolutely impressive. seat is pretty comfortable even on a prolonged ride and long enough to seat two comfortably.the bike comfortably cruises at 50-60 km/hr, though overtaking does need some planning. The vibrations from the engine are well contained.the Platina ES is well priced and with the high fuel efficiency, is a good value for money product too."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Platina,3,"The platina is a bike with a slim look and it is a useful to ride free. It is a bike with a excellent mialage. it is also used for a family's and also for a youth . it is a bike of different colours like red,white and etc.. It is a bike of very weight less and a  easy of going . A rider must feels a comfort of riding the bike of any way  with a long or a short distances . A bike carry's a 3 members in a seat comforts a free space. A bike should over goes a smooth sound it is a comfort to a rider when he rides a bike in the way of long travels and in a easy way . Now you of a every one must think in a way to buy a bike to ride in a easy of a way to a ride. So u can now to a very less cost for a bike to buy in a show room . A new bike make you a joy of a ride with in a roads ."

But I like bajaj platina bike from its some good things and some other things of this bike make me disappoint when i ride it  So  i want to share here about my bajaj platina bike experience and its some bad and good things :-"
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,awsome bike ..,5,"Bajaj Platina is a mileage bike with 96 kmpl. It comes with a 102 cc engine.It has a torque of 5000 rpm and power of 7500 rpm. This bike has 4 speed transmission with a top speed of 90 km/hr. It has a fuel capacity of 11 litres. It does not have disk brakes. It supports both self start and kick start.It is available in black, red and blue color. Overall it is a good bike considering the price and can be a best choice for one who are looThe stubby handlebar is accompanied with the never before soft handgrips, I wonder why Bajaj is not giving this small but very crucial feature in all of their bikes. I personally never like the hard plasticky handgrips of all Bajaj bikes including KTM Dukes. The new Platina also has forward set footpegs, which with plush long seat and soft handgrips actually make your ride very comfortable in both the Worlds.king for lightweight, easy to handle and a mileage bike.In our acceleration tests, it managed the sprint to 60kmph in 8.28 seconds and went on to a top speed of 87.1kmph.I am stratified Bajaj Platina 100es motorcycles I Love My Platina motorcycles my life."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj Platina The Cheapest Bike.,3,"I had brought this bike in the year 2008, because i did not have that much capital at time time so in 40k the only bike available is bajaj platina. The bike has 100cc engine, alloy wheels, analogue speedometer, kick start. As all know this mileage mention is of 100kmpl which is true, which make it cost worthy in this period of increasing petrol prices, The major drawback i got in this bike is it is very light weight because of which it becomes impossible for the bike to gain speed, yes it has good mileage but poor speed also, After three to two years its engine starts making sound which indirectly means that you have to start saving some money for the bike every year. So although it is the cheapest bike but the quality is also very cheap. Now a days lot more other bikes are available in the market at same price, So i suggest you to got to some other option in 40k bikes or add some more money and buy a good one, because its better to invest money at once instead of investing every year."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj Platina the best low budget bike ever ,4,I am using Bajaj Platina since last three months. I like it because it is Cheap in price and also give a very good mileage which is not possible with other bikes in this price range. It has comfortable seat and which is long enough so two or three people can sit easily without any problem. The new look of head is also a killer feature which I liked. The most important thing is that it can run about 90 km in one litre of fuel. That's the mileage is not just good it is the best. The only thing that I have faced that if we load something heavy article or goods on it then it doesn't perform too good. It has nice engine. AND now it also coming with many features. It ride well on roads well built means it is not too good for rural areas. But since it is cheaper and gives good mileage so I will recommend it if one has low budget and want to buy a new bike then it is the best. It looks stylish than other brands bikes in this price range. 
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Awesome bike,4,"Me and my father used bajaj platina bike continuously for two years. Petrol consumption in this bike is very low.Engine of this bike is very awesome. Look of the bike is average but new models of this bike is very awesome.seats of this bike is average in compare of other costly brand bikes.This bike is not compatible for running at 100 km per hour.service of this bike is very awesome.For a normal family,this type of fuel compatible bike is very good.we send this bike for servicing after 5-6 months.After servicing,performance of bike is awesome. But my bike is not self started.so we can't say it a smooth experience but instead of this ,my bike is start in a low kick.It is a very good thing.Clutch of bike is not so hard.in the end,my bike is very awesome and I love it .miledge of bike and average is unbeatable."

The company's cheapest offering the Platina 100 - however, is doing good business, but it sales have been constantly dropping due to high demand for Hero Splendor, HeroPassion and Hero's Dream series. To counter its rivals, Bajaj has now launched the 2015 ES Electric Start variant that is claimed to be the 'World's Mileage Championwering the Platina ES is a new 102cc singlecylinder with Bajaj's DTSi technology and ExhausTEC. The similar engine also powers the Discover 100M, but in a higher state of tune 9bhp and 9.02Nm. In the case of Platina ES, the engine is tuned to return 8bhp and 8.7Nm.In terms of design, it looks largely similar to the current Platina except for new side panels, new exhaust, slightly different headlamp design and new graphics."

Bajaj Auto recently hopped on to the right path by launching two motorcycles - the Platina ES and the refreshed CT100 - in the entry-level segment, not only to offer variety, but also to cater to this vast market."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Superb and cost saving,5,"My platina is gifted me by my father, that is the first reason why I love it most. Also if we talk about mileage it is one of the best bike I have ever seen.We can seat comfortably and enjoy the ride.Even in emergency it has helped me to hospitalise my friend.As we know long seat is very useful to carry something with one person.My platina gives average of 80 which saves my transportation cost which is nowadays too costly.it is 5 years I have been using platina and not a single time it made me sad or upset, not a single complaint.In other words platina is super and duper for my biking experience.As we see craze of bikes is tremendous, youngsters use to buy costly bikes which are not so affordable.So as to conclude this is one of the best bike in my life."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,bajaj platina bike experience,5,"I had purchased my bajaj platina in 2006 and had done the periodical service without fail from bajaj authorized service center till 2010. By the beginning of 2011 my bike engine started to create unwanted sounds and it become so unbearable that I needed to take to the service center. After the service I had driven it for two days and the sound produced by the bike is like some hammering sound on a metal sheet. I took it back to the service person and they charged me Rs 11, 000.00 for the engine work. I asked them why such an issue had happened as I am spending exorbitant money for the last four years to service my bike at the authorized center(almost Rs 12, 000 in total for a distance of 30, 000 kilometer). They just told me that the reason is some manufacturing defects. My question is that if there is some manufacturing defects then why cant they rectify it themselves. Why shoul they pass on the burden to the customers. However now the bile is in running condition, but not as smooth as earlier. Giving a mileage of 60 km. In the last 6 year I almost spent the cost of the bike itself to maintain the bike in a good condition within a total travel done below 40, 000 K.M. just pausing it as now for buying a new bike minimum I have to pay 70K+."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,The super saver bike,1,Bajaj platina is one of the best bike of the bajaj company. Some special features make it a good bike. 1st of all it comes in less price which is affordable. It consumes less oil & save the money. Model's look is also good . basically it is one of the best bike for the middle class family and for those who travel more. This bike have enough long seat. 
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Good for mielage lover..,4,"The style is not good for them who need good mileage  and easy to ride they can select this bike. this bike gives approx 90 kmpl mileage because it is 100 cc engine and the developers of bajaj company invented this bike for mileage lovers.And this bike seat is too long the people who ride triple riding or the family can sit with very comfort. and this bike cost is very cheap its starting price is 40000 and It’s a comfortable motorcycle.This bike is useless for the people who go long drives because its engine is just 100 cc capacity and suspenssion is not so good. The fuel tank has a capacity of 11.5 litres. its engine is DTS  and powerful self start,I'm using this bike since 2009 and yet to point out a heavy flaws about this bike.

Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Nice bike at cheap cost,4,Hello everyone…..My name is Shailesh gupta from Gujarat. I have been riding Bajaj platina from last 4 Years and I am here to share to my experiences about platina so that it might be helpful for anyone. 
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj Platina ,4,Hi friends…..I have been riding Bajaj Platina for last 2 years and i am satisfied with its performance
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj Platina,3,Hello friends!! 
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj Platina,3,"Hi… I am putting this review to share my experiences with Bajaj Platina. I  had purchased my bajaj platina in 2006 and had done the periodical service without fail from bajaj authorized service center till 2010. By the beginning of next year my bike engine started to create unwanted and undesirable noise. After that I took my bike to service centre but they did not resolve the trouble.  After the service I had driven it for two days and the sound produced by the bike is like some hammering sound on a metal sheet. So at last I take my bike to the local service centre, they charged me Rs 8000 for engine work. The local service center personnel disassemble the whole engine and rectify the problem. After the engine problem solved, the chain set started unwanted noise. Within the four years of using, it had many problem and several parts are tends to be changed. But the mileage of Bajaj platina is near 80 kmpl. All the other parts including suspension, handling and gripping are very nice. But the disadvantages are poor services from Bajaj and poor quality material.  "
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Awesome Bike,4,"Before two years i bought platina because i need a bike which gives 60 plus average. Today i'm very happy thay i choose platina. This bike is super cool. It has no need for frequent service. It never gave any problem in starting. It is Less in weight, so it is easy to handle on city roads. Engine does not give any problem even after very long drive. I drive 30-35 km daily. It runs smoothly. it is more comfortable than other bike of this segment. It has longer seat than other bikes. Bike price is also lower than other main bikes. As this bike has many features but this bike is not for the younger generation who prefer power over mileage.  It becomes almost impossible to control if u reach over 85 kmph and the max speed is only 98 kmph and it won't go above it. If anyone wanna use this bike for stunting just forget it. This bike is mainly for average not for show off. As this bike is light weight so it is difficult to ride on high areas. "
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Awesome bike for regular use,4,"I am a student and for going college I had a requirement of economical bike.my father bought bajaj platina for me in 2010.firstly I got upset because I need a sports bike but when I use platina for few days ,my experience with it was great.I have completed over 80000km with it and the great news is that bike is working fine till now .This bike only required engine oil change in every 1000-1200km and full servicing every 6 month that will cost around Rs.500-1000rs only. after first five service I have enjoyed up to 80 kmpl mileage on long run and in city 65-70 kmpl.bike having Less weight, so it is easy to handle on city roads. Engine does not give any problem even after very long drive.I drove continuously for 300km from ludhiana to Delhi.my bike is of old model but now the new model has many more feautres such as electric start,alloy wheels, new look which make this bike much more attractive. Overall this bike is worth for money."

Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Perfect commuter,3,"Hello everyone…..My name is Vishal Mehta from Varanasi.  I am sharing my views regarding Bajaj Platina on this Auto Portals. My experiences with this bike is awesome. This is a real commuter with very cheap cost and kinder to your pocket. I bought this bike in 2012 when I was in college. The bike looks very simple and there is no cosmetic upgrades on this bike. The 100cc engine is the best part, it generates mileage of 85 kmpl but the power and pick up of is very less. In initial days, before 1st service, it was giving mileage around 90 kmpl. Engine does not vibrates and no sound there. The condition of my bike is very good because I maintained it well, I have done timely oil change and servicing.  The bike has very long and comfortable seats and the distance between handle and seats provides comfortable and pain free journey. The suspension are nice and enough to take all road bumps. The only disadvantage is bike feels too low when it rides by heavy persons. The gripping of tyres are good, even on wet roads. Overall the bike is nice. "
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Nice for me,3,"I’m a proud owner of bajaj patina 100 from last 3 years. I had ride this bike for almost 40, 000 kms, and it gives me best experience for every km. This bike is really good one especially for city drivers, it givse very good mileage and comfort that a rider demands.it has better pickup than hero honda 100cc bikes. My bike is giving me 65-70kmpl from last 3 years consistently. I had never faced engine problems in my bike uptil now.the engine sounds like a new bike now also. The best thing about this bike is, it is very comfortable for long drive .u will not feel tired during long drive.my bike’s milege on highways is really surprising about 75-80 kmpl. In addition to this, platina’s power is more than any other 100cc bike in the market(8.2 bhp).this figure is not only theoretical actually also u will feel good power while driving this bike. My friend shashi dadlani also have this bike, which is also giving good milege(70kmpl) and performance.he is driving his bike from last 4 years for almost 60, 000. One thing here i want 2 tell that, bajaj bikes demands little bit more care towards them than hero honda bikes, If u do proper servicing at proper time u will get best results . I’m not over telling about platina, this is my real experience with my bike. Don’t think that bajaj bikes r not durable or their engines r not good.its not true at all.bajaj is progressing rapidly and their bikes r also good. So i strongly recommends this bike for all who are planning to buy new 100cc bikes ."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,nothing like platina,5,I am riding this awesome bajaj product since last 5 years and i can assure you that this is a bike worth for money...i think no one can get more reliable bike them platina at any cost.Riding experiance is good and maintainance cost is just for saying only.I dont remember when the last time i had to invest on my bajaj motor parts..I have already rided it around 50000 km and still it gives me the same fearless ride like before.I am now a very loyal customer of bajaj and their products.Love is My Platina and awesome is riding it ..Recently one of my friend also purchased platina after my sugession and he is also very happy with platina..its milage is so cost efficient and one can easyly bear its ride.A totally rough use bike and i can assure u it will never fond u disappointing..Its look is pretty cool ..even if a college going boy is riding it then also it dont look any weird ..i ll give it a perfect 10 ..I suggest every one to give it a chance and enjoy riding this....happy riding :)
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,awesome bike,5,"The company is giving new models and alterations to the body of many bikes like pulsar, discover. Why dont platina can be remodeled bring it on 150cc  give a good look to the bike surely it will be great in the market , bcoz platina is an good economical bike for an normal people. So they will also have some wish in the looks of platina. So kindly give platina a new look.but over all is good. Good mileage. Nice bike.No need for frequent service. Never gave any problem in starting. Less weight, so it is easy to handle on city roads. Average mileage in city of around 55 to 60 kmpl. Engine does not give any problem even after very long drive. I drove continuou own a Bajaj Platina, since 2 years and have received very good mileage from it. It gives me around 87 in city and 101 on highways. Only maintenance is a disadvantage. Also it does not look very stylish and is what i call best in class! Go for it if you are a mileage minded person, but if you are a rough driver then this bike is not for you !"
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Awesome Bike In Low Budget,4,"Bajaj Platina 100  as it is  100cc  bike so power is not that much  but it is a more than enough. Bike Comes with Alloy wheel and Mask  so looks is good. Bike length is better than any  bike in 100cc  segment  that mean comfort to seat. The best  part is, Bike giving a mileage over 80+ kmpl very handy to pocket  that means  you cut  monthly  expense. A good thing about platina Price is less  than 45k, so why not go for Platina  which gives comfort, mileage, and stylish look  in less  price. I’m using this bike since 19 oct 2006 and  I only change Oil regularly and change both the tyres once, do servicing in 5 month yet to point out a any flaws about this bike. Low maintenance bike. Back  looks is a bit pathetic but  side look is good  and weight of  bike is less but  its ok. Bajaj Platina 100 Kum me Bum bike for those who want to save money and want a reliable bike.i will suggest you buy Bajaj Platiina bike if you are looking for low budget bike. Thanks"
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Best Bike In Mileage.,5,"Bajaj Platina was of my first bike which I bought on last year. Main features of Platina is of it's high mileage with great fuel efficiency. Maintenance is also low. I have also travelled for long journey's also without any hesitations. It was a pleasurable ride ever on that time with my friend. Fuel was sufficient in amount during our rides because to it's fuel efficiency. Head, Tail and fog lamps were well designed. Overall look of bike is stylish in anyway with it's new graphics. Along with new alloy wheels too. Seating was comfortable too ride In village and narrow roads. I felt like I was riding a horse instead of bike due to it's smooth running experience. I went for many trips in my bike and felt a new experience ever to share. The thing is how you ride it and make it more easily in any circumstances. I am sure that whoever owns this bike will never regret of buying further on. Although you will get new experiences with loads of memorable moments with every ride with this bike. So enjoy your rides and share your experiences also like as me."

Fuel tank capacity is around 13.5 which is ok.Max torque is 8.05Nm at 4500  rpm. ground clearance is 165.00 mm.it has 4 stroke engine.so overall a good bike as mileage , cost of bike ,maintenace and service avaliablity all over india.

Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,designing is awesome,3,"I am a customer of Bajaj Platina 100CC and I am using it for more than 9 years, it is the best bike I had ever used because of its durability. The engine which is the DTSii engine makes it a very good bike with a high pick-up. It has got very stylish design which gives modern look to the bike. The bike has very good aerodynamic balance which helps to balance the bike very easily. The mileage of the bike is very high. It gives a mileage of 75-85 depending on how you drive. It is the best bike in its range as compared to Honda Twister, Hero Splender and many others. The Dual suspensions of the bike make the ride comfortable. The bike runs smoothly and much shocks are not felt even on poor roads. It is truly the value for money bike in its range and it is also the best starter bike for a new rider"

Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj is Bajaj ,5,"I am bike addicted.  I used many brands bike but still love my fathers bajaj.  The milage of Bajaj is too good.  I used to asked father to change the bike, this is too old fashion bike.  But riding once I it's too comfortable bike. The bike is light weight. It's speed is quite slow.  In short I can say it's truly Indian bike. This bike takes less space for parking. Even in rainy day I used my it's face no problem. In loading also this bike runs smoothly.  I always prefer people to purchase this if you want good bike at low budget.  In future if I  purchase any  bike I would buy from bajaj.  Bajaj is well known for finance also.  You can finance your bike from bajaj finance and pay money in instalment.  Bajaj is easy to use.  Warranty service are also good.  In short it's totally family bike for every one.  Bike has three person capacity. I saw many bike heat easily eve aftern running 1 km but bajaj had no problems like that. In last I would say bajaj is Bajaj. "
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj Platina The Cheapest Bike.,3,"I had brought this bike in the year 2008, because i did not have that much capital at time time so in 40k the only bike available is bajaj platina. The bike has 100cc engine, alloy wheels, analogue speedometer, kick start. As all know this mileage mention is of 100kmpl which is true, which make it cost worthy in this period of increasing petrol prices, The major drawback i got in this bike is it is very light weight because of which it becomes impossible for the bike to gain speed, yes it has good mileage but poor speed also, After three to two years its engine starts making sound which indirectly means that you have to start saving some money for the bike every year. So although it is the cheapest bike but the quality is also very cheap. Now a days lot more other bikes are available in the market at same price, So i suggest you to got to some other option in 40k bikes or add some more money and buy a good one, because its better to invest money at once instead of investing every year"

I must wear  helmate while riding my bike.  when i will bought a new bike I will prefer for Bajaj bike. a disappointment  for me  that this bike is with out electric start. i will say that for you, when you want to buy a new bike, first you ride an bajaj bike of you friend circle. you will see the result. bajaj bikes are cheap compair to other bike company.  when you buy an bajaj bike, you will have not to pay any charge for next 4-5 year for mentenance. if you care your bike then this time period  will be more than this.  after sale service is quite goot or you can say that after sale service is brillient. mentenance cost after the purchase your bike is very low compair to any other bike company. i will say that think about it before you purchase your bike. i have a great experiance with bajaj bikes."

Good :	Mileage, Comfort, Fule Tank Capacity, Stability, Rug performance"
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Nice bike with Superb milage.,4,"My experience is that this is good if you are 1. maintaining it well (dont go on low maintainece cost as suggested by many like 1800 in four years). Timely oil change and servicing will do good. 2. In one hand - you share it with many guys and the result will be not far. I required engine work at 38000 km only, because I handed the keys to many guys over this period.   No doubt with guys on this forum who rode 60-70000 kms and happy because this is really good. Fuel wise very economical. In initial days, before 1st service, it was giving mileage around 90 kmpl. But very soon it comes around 60. after 2 servicing I say. I spent a lot of time, I remember, in bajaj service centre, arguing, why it cant give a mileage now what it was before, but to no avail. If you are lucky and maintaining it in true way, may be you can get 70 also.  :-( Disadvantage:- very light weight, I remember times, when I turned more than 90 degree when I applied sudden brakes. Over all its a very cool bike.."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Bajaj Platina 100 ES review,3,"As the name suggests, the new variant gets an electric starter which was badly missed in the erstwhile model. The Platina ES is long and sleek in the flesh, with a refreshed front fascia that it largely carries forward from the regular Platina. But overall, the ES is almost completely redesigned."
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Mileage king,5,"While I’ve never been a fan of motorcycles that sip rather than burn away their fuel, I have to admit that I’m quite intrigued with the Bajaj Platina 100 ES. Bajaj claim that this little 100cc motor will sip on one litre of fuel for the better part of 97 kilometres, inching ever so close to the 100kmpl mark. Since most motorcycles give a higher figure on the highway mileage run, we might actually cross that magic mark – this test should be fun."

Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Awesome Bike for regular use ,4,Platina is a awesome bike for regular use. Since I have been using this bike from 5 years it gives superb mileage of approx 70-75 kmpl. Maintenance of this bike is also very less than the other bikes of this class. It is very comfortable bike for long ride due its body design. The bike has a better grip on road while turnings and twists as it comes with alloy rims and big ted blocks which gives it a better grip in the season of rain and monsoon. the bike has good speed approx 100-110 kmph. The pick-up of the bike is also very good. Bike reaches 0-60 in a very lesser time comparatively to other. The graphics and look of bike is very good. As platina comes with 100cc engine but the engine of this bike is very powerful. I can easily load approx 3 quintal of weight with no problem.

Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,A super bike i owned,4,"While I’ve never been a fan of motorcycles that sip rather than burn away their fuel, I have to admit that I’m quite intrigued with the Bajaj Platina 100 ES. Bajaj claim that this little 100cc motor will sip on one litre of fuel for the better part of 97 kilometres, inching ever so close to the 100kmpl mark. Since most motorcycles give a higher figure on the highway mileage run, we might actually cross that magic mark – this test should be fun"
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,very bad spare parts assemble in this bike,1,This is very very bad bike...
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,impressive ,4,"it's been 5 years now since i bought bajaj platina it had no problem at all. I like its looks and it's comfort. Because of my profession I've to travel a lot and in long distance journey it felt very comfortable. i use to put a lot of weight on it but still it stays as comfortable as it was. Because of its unique design it always stays comfortable and in speed. i am really a tough rider i took it out in rainy seasons where in delhi we have a lot of holes on roads and blockage causes the road to get totally drowned in water but even on that stage where cars can't move, i easily ride out. engine is as powerful as (not as hulk though) required. The best part is mileage(what we Indians really cares about) you should know it gives 87.87 KMPL. enough to take you very far from others. customer support is very good and bajaj is an Indian company. and budget yes ! i am damn sure that it will definitely fits in your budget because it's just 43,241( price for nov 2015) in ex showroom. so i highly recommend you to buy this and feel the amazing comfort and style. "
Bajaj Platina 110,4.0,Simple sober and best indian commuter,4,"Bajaj platina was my first bike. The only bike in its segment with good looks, features, less price & most importantly mileage. The first thing any middle class person will prefer is high mileage from his bike in college days. I used this bike around two and a half year then i gave it to my uncle so now he uses for his daily commute. To be honest i am around 6 feet tall and platina doesn't suit me so i switched to pulsar 220. So if you are a tall guy i recommend you not to invest in this bike. But if you are looking for mileage its the perfect bike for you. When i was using the bike it used to return me about 85kmpl which is now degraded to around 82-83kmpl after so much of use which is not bad. If we talk about the looks, its quite simple but way better than the other brands. The bike is sleek and can cut through traffic easily. Power is the only thing you would feel less because of its 100cc engine which churns around 8 bhp i guess but still the performance is good. I didn't liked the seat as it was bite uncomfortable to ride on a hard seat for long rides. But as the seating position is straight up right you wont feel any pain in one hour of riding. If maintained and services properly this bike will serve you the best it can give. Spare parts of this bike are easily available anywhere and also in cheap price. In case of servicing bajaj service centres are very poor. One thing i noticed is that the fitting of the headlamps is bit loose. If not covered in rainy season water enters inside the headlamp. Not yet sure from where does the water accumulates inside it. I will suggest bajaj to look after this issue."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Love at first sight.. ,4,"One fine day i had an urge to get a bike. I started doing my research and was getting somewhere with the likes of karizma 220, tvs apache 180 but then i laid my eyes on this. Oh man oh man! i fell in love at first sight. Of-course the design was a bit way too much for me. But guess what, i was in college at that time whatever thing had to offer i wanted it. I was also given the option of the rc 200. For what it's worth, i was very much deviating towards the rc only. However the low mileage and the lack of abs is what made me change my mind. The dealership in the whole Mumbai didn't have the black colour but i was hell bent on getting the black one only. So i ended up buying it from Executive bajaj. The whole process was super smooth. The chaps there were extremely helpful and straightforward. I paid in cash so can't say much about how the financing system really worked.So far it's been more than 2 years that i've had this baby and it's been a sweet right. For my riding style, it has enough oomph. I'm satisfied. The red line is usually around 10.5k and the low end performance is not that great. So yeah the acceleration is not that thrilling as compared to maybe.. An rc 200. At the same time, the mid and top end really shine on this thing. Oh how eager this engine is at those levels. Plus the handling is also neat thanks to the zappers which came pre-installed. Also, the riding position is definitely not aggressive at all, rather, just the right amount. So it doesn't kill your back on long rides. The front leds over the projector lamps look good where as the main headlights provide superb illumination at night. The abs works as expected and has literally saved my life a few time. Here's a good thing to note people, don't compromise on abs.. If you can get it, get it. It'll change your life. The shockers at front are alright but sometimes a but too soft whereas the monoshock on the back is decent. These shocks seem to be tuned for indian roads and potholes :) the engine is liquid cooled so. The radiator does a good job in keeping it cool, i have not run out of coolant yet. The looks obviously are a bit to aggressive. On top of that some people laminate the front visor and remove the rear view mirrors to give it a proper indian squid vibe. My advise, don't do that, it's ugly. Follow safety norms and don't stunt on main roads.Pros:1.) the best value for money for the current indian segment2.) sports breed but doesn't kill your back3.) the pillion seat is better than that of the rc and other bikes in this segment 4.) comes with abs. Even though its single channel only, it's there! 5.) low maintenance as compared to other bikes in this segment. Cons:1.) the damn hud. Man this thing has driven me crazy. Sometimes it turns on sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it restarts in the middle of me riding, resets my trips and the clock and sometimes it works fine. 2.) the pillion seat is after all not that amazing. There's nothing to hold onto other than the unrealistic grab rails which are withing the bike frame only. If you've got a girl on your back, she'll be in a better position than being on an rc ofcourse, but she'll hate the whole ride, her back with start to pain, unless of-course she leans on you and sit properly like it's intended to. Well.. 3.) a bit too heavy. Weighs around 165 kgs."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Mind blowing Performance,5,"The Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 ABS is a mind blowing and fabulous performance bike. Anyway, before I hit the track on the RS200, I was given a crisp download of the product. The bike has undergone some major, and some not-so-major revisions compared to the Pulsar 200NS - the product which the RS200 is chiefly based on. However, all that chatter needs to translate into actual performance advantage - with the RS200, it does."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,  my First ride ,4,"Before I start off with my impression of the Bajaj Pulsar RS200 after the brief ride I had on it at Bajaj's test track in Chakan, I must accept that I suffer from a little paranoia and reluctance when it comes to the Pulsar name. I've had a love-hate relationship with the Bajaj Pulsar. I've ridden all the Pulsars to come out till now, and have had some really good moments with them. I also suffered a very severe accident a decade-and-a-half ago while riding the original Pulsar 180 that almost cost me my life. That's stuck with me ever since."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,"BAJAJ PULSAR RS200 full review DESIGN,ENGINE",4,"DESIGN:- The Pulsar RS 200's sportsbike looks are contemporary, but really busy and flashy, making this a bike that is not going to appeal to conservative buyers. A wide, see through visor sits in front offering a clear view ahead at night. The twin headlights do a brilliant job of lighting the road ahead, just as on previous Pulsars."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,RS 200,5,Vry gud bike and vry good service provide by the bajaj company...
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,A GOOD BIKE IN LOOKS AND VALUE FOR MONEY,4,"Bikes look good and sexy in shape.Black color looks sexy..Wider shape means that it feels bulkier and more muscular. Its thicker handlebar grips have an enhanced texture and reinforce the feel of control, despite it being a large bike. Riding the bike is simple and enjoyable: the overall seating position is predominantly upright, ideal for moving through city traffic, and the seat has been positioned higher in conjunction with a shortened wheelbase, lending it greater agility. The fuel tank has a capacity of 12 litres. When moving through traffic it feels smooth and refined.The next on my agenda is to go to Ladakh on my bike with my bro-in-law on his Avenger (I bet he will imitate the Feel like god commercial once he reaches there  )."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Good looking and Excellent Bike of the Year,5,"Guys i just wanted to share our experience here, Style is awesome. Tail lamp is very good looking although some may hate it. It makes evry1 turn der heads towards it. that's for sure."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4,"The RS200 is not as entertaining as the R15 or the RC200 - those bikes are in proper full-attack mode from the word go, whereas with the RS, you need to spend more and more time on it to get familiar with its boundaries and character. Its limits are not as great as its rivals from KTM and Yamaha, but at being a flaunt machine, the RS200 might just be good enough for some unusual college-goers.The tail-lamps, too, are just a bit too weird, and the rear section from the front seat on, leading up to the lights reminds me a bit of the Karizma and the original Xtreme by Hero. Strange, I know. The RS200 looks a bit over-the-top, a bit too try-hard, a bit silly, a bit brash, and a bit fussy. It gives a sense that Bajaj designers were deliberately thinking hard to make the RS200 stand out. It may have worked in a way though - the RS does catch the eye easily, but not in the most pleasing ways. Overall It is a Good bike and worth my money. :D "
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,bike is best at its price range,5,The Bajaj Pulsar RS200 impressed us on the race track
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,good milleage with superb pickup ,4,"I have purchase this bike on aug and from my experienced till now its  a very good bike as compare to other bike which comes  in same range and pickup is also very good  and the milleage is also near about 50 which is also good and the main thing which is like is its sports look and the technology which is used in it is also very superb  and its also has a powerful sport engine and the backseat is also very good for couples and it also have a powerful breaking system    and bajaj also have a vast service network  and it's service center people in indore is also very good  and  it also have Twin projector headlamps, crystal LED tail light, aggressive muscular styling, nitrox mono suspension, perimeter frame, triple-spark 4-valve DTSi engine, fuel injection system, race exhaust and  it crosses 0-100 speed in 10 seconds  and Like other Pulsar bikes, the RS200 also comes equipped with an analog-digital instrument console. It features an analog tachometer with digital speedometer, digital odometer, digital trip-meters and clock. The ABS version also features an ABS on/off light. And it cost about 1.35 lakhs  and the disadvantage is that it is very heavy "
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Dream Bike Pulsar,3,I have Bajaj pulsar RS 200  and it is very good. It has 10 liter fuel tank  capacity moreover it gives approx 40 km/liter on highway and 30 km/liter in city.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Best Bike,5,"I bought this bike in the evening of 4 July. And from that day I rode it 384 kms, there is nothing which is lacking in performance or in any other things. The bike is very excellent in performance, I took it to 149 kmph and it catches the speed very easily. There is no sign of vibration above 135 kmph , thanks to its pressed perimeter frame to handle the engine at high revs. The bike is awesome at high speed and very very very much stable at corners and road due to its weight. Which is very good for race lovers. This gives the mileage of around 34-35 kmpl. Which increased to 38-40kmpl after first service. So no concerns for so much refilling of tank. And in the last the looks of the bike is awesome from the purchase date more than 100 people asked me about the bike. The overall performance of the bike is awesome. Even 220 is unmatched in performance with bike. So the other bikes likes KARIZMA ZMR, R15, APACHE, CBR150R have to stand in the footpath, when it comes on the road. Who is planning to buy it , I personally suggest him buy today and feel the soul of bike."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,a powerful bike with good milleage,4,"I have purchased pulsar 200 RS in Aug The most advanced Pulsar yet, the new Bajaj Pulsar 200 RS is nothing less than a super-bike in terms of design. The complicated looking front of RS200 houses projector lamps for increased visibility and style with an addition of LED eyebrows, which boosts its aggressiveness to a new level. Small yet attractive exhaust adds to its racing appeal. Body cuts and curves are marvellous and they definitely will leave all of your side thoughts behind. "

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,"Styling, performance ",5,"The Pulsar RS200 is a feisty full-fairing offering from Bajaj, which packs in the great price-performance in its class . It is also fast, no doubt. But, its true highlight is it's easy to ride nature.The moment you start the bike, you’ll be welcomed by a familiar engine noise. Yes- it sounds like a combination of the KTM’s roar and the NS’s purr. The revv-happy engine builds the revs quickly yet smoothly, and there is plenty of power available on the tap (24.5 HP at 9750 Rpm, thanks to the Bosch EFI system) when you rev it >8000 Rpm. The engine can Pull from as low as 25 Km/h in 5th, thanks to the DTS-i head. The Bike is pretty nimble and can be used for daily commutes and for those occasional long weekend Highway rides as well. It comes with MRF tubeless radial tires, which are medium compound ones. The tires gripped well, great for an OEM provided set. Braking duties are handled by the Bulbous 300 mm single disc in the front and a 230mm disc at the rear. They’re Bybre calipers, with the brakes having good feedback. They get steel braided lines as standard, which is a welcome addition. I got to ride the Non-ABS variant and thus, can’t comment on the ABS’ function and quality."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Excellent Performance And Dashing Look,5,Pulsar 200 RS is a great bike with beautiful design and economical price.The front and rear seats are both comfortable.The headlight is really good that enables bikers to ride smoothly even when the visibility is very low to few meters.The tyres are tubeless and are of finest quality with good wheels.But what I feel disappointed with the tyres are its size.I feel if the size of the tyres would have been larger it would have been even great.The roadgrip is really good.The engine is similar to that of pulsar 200 NS except the fuel injection system which is slightly modified.The power rating is good with horse power of 24 bhp and peaks out at 9750 rpm.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Not Good Bike For Money,3,Style is Excellent. Tail lamp is very good looking although some may hate it. because of old model style and design and price

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,PULSAR RS 200 ,4,"I was very excited when I got my  Bajaj Pulsar RS200,  It was the most anticipated motorcycle from Bajaj because it was going to open the doors of the budget fully-faired entry-level performance motorcycles. With India’s ever growing young population, the Pulsar RS200 seems to have attracted lot of interest. Pulsar RS200 is the prettiest motorcycle with the Bajaj badge. The overall design language is fresh and aggressive. Some design inspiration is visible from the Japanese but the Indian industrial designers have done a good job. But while I appreciate their effort, I find the motorcycle’s design a bit too busy. The front fascia reminds me of the Bumblebee from the famous Transformers property. Look very closely and the placements of the two projector headlamps will remind you of the rattlesnake – very aggressive, and with a character of its own.  It gets two LED pilot lamps, which are flanked by small decals to make the design lively. The turn indicators are the ones seen on the KTM Duke 200. The windscreen is big and quite useful during rides."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,a awasome bike,5,"While comparing with other 200CC bikes,Bajaj Pulsar stands ahead.I have been Using this bike this for last 6 years and never faced any issue.Awesome and unique style inspired me alot.The RS200 comes powered by a 4-valve, triple spark, DTSi engine with fuel injection and liquid cooling. The engine delivers 24.5Ps of power and 18.6Nm of torques. Bajaj says that the RS200 redlines at 11000rpm and top speed is rated at 141km/h.I bought this bike after reading so many reviews on different sites and most of the reviews were positive which forced me to buy this and After using it continuously i can say that it was a wise decision to buy Bajaj Pulsar.I would love to give it 5 Stars In my point of view it is the best piece of Bajaj which has every feature.. have already recommended it to most of my friends.So if you are looking for a stylish bike with high average and affordable price then go for it."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bike for speed lovers.....awesome bike,5,"The Bajaj Pulsar RS200 packs a ergonomic frugality, nice punch and a decent amount of features. It is beautifully designed and the pickup is quite impressive. The large front of bike encases the entire engine. The front lights are LED with beautiful projectors looking good. It has tubeless tyres which is quite helpful at the time of puncture. I mean to say in that condition you can also run even bike is punctured. It has double disc brakes and alloy wheels which provides the motorcycle more stability. It gives me awesome riding experience because of the riding position is quite sporty. Brakes are powerful and more so with the rear brake.the bike is awesome at high speed and very very very much stable at corners and road due to its weight. Which is very good for race lovers. The first drawback of this bike is that it is very heavy  in weight and another is that it has only 13 litres of fuel tank which is not so good. It gives me a mileage of 30 to 35 kmpl which is not satisfied"
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,The Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 ABS,5,"The Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 ABS is a mind blowing and fabulous performance bike. Anyway, before I hit the track on the RS200, I was given a crisp download of the product. The bike has undergone some major, and some not-so-major revisions compared to the Pulsar 200NS - the product which the RS200 is chiefly based on. However, all that chatter needs to translate into actual performance advantage - with the RS200, it does."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj Pulsar RS200 - Ownership review,4,"One of the best value for money bike in the segment in spec wise as well as on the practical side. The engine is peppy and meets all your expectations as an entry level sports bike. It is also good for daily commuting and for weekend touring. Comfort in riding is due to good upright seating posture makes no back pain or wrist pain. Onroad presence is also the best similar to 300+ CC bikes in the market. When compared to Yamaha R15 V3 which is a feature-rich bike and KTM RC200 the track bike both are also better options but not ideal for touring due to aggressive seating posture. If you are on a budget of under 2 lacs, Bajaj Pulsar RS200 is the best option to choose whether to tour or for daily commuting with a good mileage of around 35 KMPL. Cons - fairing vibration after 7000 RPM and lack of slipper clutch. Due to these reasons, I gave it a 4-star rating. Overall, it is a VFM offering from Bajaj India."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,The best of all time,5,The bike is perfect for the youth. Bajaj has given all young and fresh elements in this bike as it always does. The bike keeps the competition levels higher.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,3,"I bought dual-tone black RS 200 abs at last month and the on-road price of this bike is 1,69,000 Hyderabad  This bike with good features and mainly daylights look and pickup was super and sporty and overall its look like a premium bike. The exhaust is awesome sound droom droom . I like that so much and one thing I disappointed about dust regularly we have to clean it and. it was so delicate bike but strong body if you want to maintain it well then you have to do regular service if you get any vibration and etc just give the bike to service centre don't give it outside mechanic. And one more thing about the bike it has more chances to start without a key so keep it in the security area and it has good safety features like stand alert. Accident alert and direct fuel injection. And mileage about this bike it was giving me 35kmph. I drive this bike at 60 to 70 speed if Your budget is 2lakhs just close your eyes and bye it. "

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Good but not that good - Bajaj Pulsar RS200,3,Numbers do matter in Bajaj Pulsar RS200. This can literally reach up to 140+KMPH. Personally I have reached a speed of 148 KMPH. But after some years you can't have this machine. The engine noise will be higher and performance will gradually go down.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Best bike in this price range.,5,This bike is just fantastic as its pickup is best in this price range.

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Nice and excellent bike.,5,Looking wise this bike is great and pickup and mileage are too good. Very smooth if I go to high speed.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Best in the segment.,5,This bike has enough power in 200 segments. If you ignore some vibration from instrument console than there is no other disadvantage of this bike. Stable at high speed and braking system with ABS RS200 is value for money. 
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Sporty and killer looks,5,"I had always wanted to purchase a more sporty and well-built motorcycle for myself, and when I decided to purchase at price of  200 for about two lacs, my wish came true. The six-speed gear mechanism makes for a very enjoyable driving experience. Additionally, it feels so very light that I am at a loss for words. Very pleasant and smooth ride."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Good looking bike.,5,Best price for a 200cc model for a branded bike.
Bajaj Pulsar NS 125,4.2,Pulsar NS 125 Is Comfortable For The Rider,4,"My interest was drawn in by the Bajaj Pulsar NS 125's remarkable features and appearance. Although the rider's seat is rather comfortable, I must admit that the pillion seat may occasionally be a little uncomfortable. Longer journeys may not be as pleasurable for the pillion rider since the seat may not offer the same amount of support and cushioning. However, the Pulsar NS 125 still provides a comfortable ride for the user, even if they typically travel alone or with a few pillion passengers. Overall, it is a good bike only they can work a little on the seat. "
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Best sports bike,4,"One can write a lot about RS 200 due to being so attractive but I will say two things, it is one of the best sports bikes in the segment as it has a good 199.5cc of the engine and which is lightweight with six-speed transmission. Also, it gives good enough mileage as well."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Beast in looks,4,"Before launching, this model company named it as SS model but later changed it to RS. It became one of the hottest-looking bikes in the segment. The front side looks like a beast in red and white color plus it is in an effective price range. "
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Very attractive and reasonable,4,"The bike is very easy to manage and exhibits its original power while accelerating beyond 6000 revolutions per minute. The bike requires little money to maintain. In comparison to all faired motorcycles, the seat position is also generally pleasant. I've driven about 5000 kilometers on it and have taken several trips on it. It has a fantastic fuel economy of 35 to 37 kilometers per liter, making it the greatest 200cc sports bike."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Pickup works well,3,"Those seats are awful. For short trips only, use this bike. Back and shoulder soreness will result from using this for lengthy rides. Ergonomic design is not present in this bicycle. The ground clearance on this bike is really low. Silence on every breaker"
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Highly Improved Vehicle,4,"The Pulsar RS200's peak speed is 151 kmph, according to Bajaj, although I was able to reach 144 kmph on the straightaway at the test track. The bike's overall weight has increased by a whopping 20kg as a result of the added fairing and the ABS unit. Despite being so heavy, the RS200 performed admirably on the highway."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,The most attractive - Pulsar RS200,4,"The general design aesthetic is modern and assertive. Although the Japanese are a source of some design inspiration, Indian industrial designers did an excellent job. But even while I value their effort, I believe the motorcycle's look is a little overdone."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj could have done better - Pulsar RS 200,5,"The front fascia of RS 200 is dashing, and it has the capabilities to charm anyone. But looks are not everything the ride quality is a bit poor and stiff. I think Baja could do better with it. The switching from first gear to second gear is rigged and feels like one requires effort to do that. "

The only problem occur in this is only disc breaking problem. The mileage of my bike is about 45Km/l. Its graphics and sport wheel are superbbb. No any disturbance on speed greater than 135km/h. It has wonderful pickup and regarding as fast and best bike as compared to any other bike. You can smoke anyone with this mind blowing speed. But bajaj have to improve this bike technically because he can much better as we aspect. I suggest all my friends to buy bajaj pulsar 220 because of its enormous speed and comfortable handling.
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,most amazing bike i owned till now,5,Pulsar 220 F..the most amazing bike i bought till now. Its best in everything whether look wise or by performance.

Bike is comfortable for long routes also. Stylish bike. Person riding this bike has a different personality. I prefer pulsar better than duke. Its engine gives good performance of riding. I haven't faced a single problem yet from this bike. Also my family bought it as it is not costly compared to its feautures. And the best thing is that anyone can ride this whether young or old. Everyone looks perfect om this. Among all bikes of bajaj pulsar is best. Even every pulsar model is superb. I just wanna thank bajaj for this awesome bike. M a rider now.

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,pulsar 220 f ,4,I used it only 1 year 
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Excellent Bike for Everyday Use,5,"When I planned to purchase a new bike, I shortlisted some best bikes available in the market. 1. Apache RTR 160 (Double Disk) 2. Pulsar DTS-i 150 3. Trigger 150 (Double Disk) 4. FZS V2.0. These all bikes are best in their class. I want to purchase a bike which should be good in city mileage, with great comfort and in a medium price range. After a long research I found that Pulsar is the only bike which can provide me these features in a good price range. So let's look about the features of Pulsar 150 DTS-i. Pros: 1. MILEAGE - When we plan to purchase a new bike our first priority is its mileage. There is no doubt about the Pulsar's mileage that, it provide 50 KMPL in city. 2. COMFORT - The sitting position of this bike too good and its suspension is also good as it work good on bad roads and off road. 3. HANDLING - Bajaj has improved the handling in this bike which make this bike in great control in market ride and good stability on high speed. 4. ENGINE- The new pulsar has a improved engine than the old one. The sound feels good. RATING:- Design and Style- 8/10 Instrument Console- 8.5/10 Engine & Performance- 8.5/10 Comfort while Riding- 9/10 Mileage- 9/10 Brakes and Suspension- 9/10 Ride and handling- 9/10 Price- 8/10"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Best Bike In Best Price,5,"comparing with other 200CC bikes,Bajaj Pulsar stands ahead.I have been Using this bike this for last 6 years and never faced any issue.Awesome and unique style inspired me alot.The RS200 comes powered by a 4-valve, triple spark, DTSi engine with fuel injection and liquid cooling. The engine delivers 24.5Ps of power and 18.6Nm of torques. Bajaj says that the RS200 redlines at 11000rpm and top speed is rated at 141km/h.I bought this bike after reading so many reviews on different sites and most of the reviews were positive which forced me to buy this and After using it continuously i can say that it was a wise decision to buy Bajaj Pulsar.I would love to give it 5 Stars In my point of view it is the best piece of Bajaj which has every feature.. have already recommended it to most of my friends.So if you are looking for a stylish bike with high average . take care use always hemetsIts just awesome..Had plenty of trips in this bike.I personally feel very happy.Missed few accidents because of good brakes especially the rear brakes works beautifully. its a bit heavy n certain times I don get confidence at wet terrains during cornering... rest all is fine... I have used few bikes earlier... but this bike stays on top of list in terms of performance n power delivery.. I had gone up to 148 km/hr with pillion ... I think it can do a bit more at least adding 2km/hr to make it into 150 series....its worth the money u pay... definitely duke 200 is much better than mine.. n coming to the mileage ... mine gives 37+ in cities and 40+ in highways.. it obviously depends on the rider... so overall its a good bike... pillion seating s not much comfortable in terms of cruising... so finally if there s no pain there is no gain.overall the bike performs the bst good mileage good power aesome look that everybody should "
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,dissapointed,4,"I bought a new Bajaj Pulsar 220 in 2012 as my previous pulsar which made me a very happy man was stolen.  My earlier bike gave me steady milage of 55kmpl and was low on maintanance. But my new pulsar 220 has a milage of 37-40 max. Have changed brake liner twice, cables a couple of times, battery once and that too in the 1st year itself. I am very disappointed with the performance,  milage and high maintenance cost. Have promised myself NEVER will I buy a bajaj product again. Be wise - think twice. "
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,bajaj avenger,4,I took bajaj avenger on rent when I went to goa in january 2015. I have travelled entire north goa and south goa with this bike and let me tell you it was too comfortable for me to ride for a long stretch. People having back problems and still want to ride should prefer this bike. Also the fuel consumption of the bike is low.The handling and control is quite good. The look of the bike is also pretty awesome.
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Excellent,5,"

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,A Great Combiation Of Power & Beauty,4,"There is absolutely no doubt about the style. Preferably I liked it.Some may not like it. Everyone has their own likings. So no objection for style.Engine performance is awesome.I came to know that 200ns's engine performance in good compared to 220. I dont no as I haven't ridden it yet. But 220 has a great power. Mine is new one, purchased on 27th February 2014. It's pickup is super. Its super smooth engine makes you happy while riding it. Its power can pull the bike fastly in busy traffic. Fuel economy, they say(company) it gives 40 +, but I don't think so, its above 35 but not above 40. I haven't checked my bikes economy as it new. Gearbox is not smooth(mine one), even after first service its hard. Handling is good. As its a big bike, turning radius is large but not as large as avenger, one can manage. When the bike is at still position you cant pull back or move forward. Its very heavy(for me,as I felt).I dint gave deep review about the bike as I'm not a biker nor expert rider. Actually I went to book 200ns. But it didn't suit for my height, so obviously 220f came to my hand. Im satisfied with the bike , but not fully.  Now it has become old . A little bit change in the design, performance, and also displacement could make that bike to reach to the sky. As I said it has become old, it doesn't mean that its not a good bike, if it was so I wouldn't have purchased it now. As 200ns is technically improved, I would like to suggest that bike too."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,beast in the range,5,"I bought my bike 1month back from a local dealer for 1lac aprx and from the day I am happy with the power that it delivers.after first servicing it delivers mileage of 45kmpl aprx. 0-60kmpl in aprx 4sec. Speed, milege,comfort,safet, its a combo of everything. I am too much happy with my decision for buying pulsar 220."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Great Experience,4,"Bajaj is the best company we have ever seen in manufacturing Automobiles.That too in pulsar is awesome.220F!! that is cool and one can get pickup in a faster way than any other bikes.Firstly, when ignition turns on there is a feeling like that you are going on a plane and not on a road.That feeling one cannot experience when we use other bikes.Secondly,after turning the smoke released is very light and it is very good to use these eco-friendly one's.The indicator's are working good and the lights are working in a excellent way .The design is very flexible and convenient to understand the intricacies involved in the design of the automobile.Mileage gives us more confidence in this super or god-made bike. We are feeling very friendly in using these bike for very long distances.Other person also feels comfortable even though they are not riding.This confidence must be present in everyone even"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Great Looks and Superior Ride,4,"Hello everyone, this is Himanshu, I own pulsar 220 F since 2 years and to say honestly everytime I ride the bike it feels as if its brand new!"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Bajaj is awesome,5,"Bajaj pulsar  is a super bike. The Bajaj 220F(DTS-i) which was launched in 2009 with a killer price tag, mainly aimed at increasing sales and bringing the performance biking within reach to the common man. But the steps taken by Bajaj was a unique one, they stepped back in terms of technology, they gave the 220 a carburetor instead of the existing Fuel-injection. But with this change they were able to reduce cost, increase power (21PS),torque and mileage , which made it a instant success within the masses. The aggressive pricing being the main attraction among the youth and growing breed of Serious Performance biking community of India. Now I got my Bike on March 2010. The parts that attracted me the most, the looks(I was a sucker for the twin projector headlights, the LED console), the touring friendly ergonomics, the power and torque and then the killer price tag. All in all it was the perfect vehicle, Complete Value for Money product and it was still a rare machine in my locality, all the more reason to opt for this bike."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Super Bike 220,4,"Salute to bajaj , being an Indian manufacturer they are doing so good in Automobiles. I hope one day they will make bikes even better than others .Awesome bike...... made by a India for India and I love hows about it being an entry level of  motorcycle. Sure it's sporty, and good looking. Service at Service center is poor! but bike so super really like it much and bajaj pulsar is my heart .pulsar  king of the bikes. very good bike in the world.Which world do you live in? Fuel is not produced in factories. Its supply is limited and finite. Recklessly spending it is not a bragging point anymore. Lower the cc of engine, higher the fuel efficiency and greater the ""greenness"" of the bike.Yes we'd all like to get a real bike but in the third world a 220 is big time.  anything above that is only for the super rich or drug dealers. I live in india and a 220 Pulsar is a hot bike for here.  because these people don't make the kinda money to ever in their wildest dreams afford to buy a ""real bike"" as you say.  so you have to understand the target market of these cheap bikes from india.  they're not for the 1st world.Naye Bharat Ki Nayi Raftar - this statement alone speaks everything -1.The New Bike 2.The New Version of Pulsar, 3.The Evolution of Bajaj and above all 4.The Emerging Super-power - INDIA."

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,BEAST,2,"At the price point at which the Pulsar 220F is available, there is no other bike which can challenge the abilities of the Pulsar 220F for being a 200cc+ motorcycle below 1-lakh mark. However, the one motorcycle which tries to match the credentials of the Pulsar 220F is the Hero Karizma.  Overall value for money product, when it comes to packaging of the product in the sub-1 lakh price bracket. Offering a gazillion of equipment along with a punchy engine under its skin in this price range is certainly a good feat for the motorcycle."

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Comfortable and Smooth,4,"I had already rode Bajaj Pulsar 150,180 and 135.Considering all the mentioned i found that Bajaj pulsar 220F is best of all in the category of comfort and smooth ride. I have Bajaj pulsar 220f since 6 months and i am very much satisfied with its comfort, speed, and the performance of engine."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,A ride to remember,4,"I own the first fastest Indian – Pulsar 220, the bike that opened the gates for all the bikers out there waiting for some power to thrill and style to show-off. My red beast is pretty quick and efficient as it reaches out a top speed of 143kmph and returns me a mileage of around 35kmpl. I have a knack of riding fast and when you have 220, the habit stays for long. The appearance of the bike is quite aerodynamic, which simply complements the true power of the engine and makes me go gaga about it. From projector headlight to LED tail lamp, this machine is truly designed to blow the minds. Fat rear tyre with disc brake makes it possible to stop this machine at a speed of 80kmph or so in seconds."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Extraordinary Bike,5,"My name is Gopi ,I m from A.p , My rating For Pulsar 220 is 5 out of 5. Front look with the projector lamp is something which will make you stand out in the traffic. Side look takes the rating away as you will feel there is something missing near your bike's engine. Exhaust gives one extra star if you are a fan of big exhaust. Rear look is very much similar to other pulsars and that makes it very common look on the road. For those who love the signature tail light of pulsar, will like this also. There is nothing to be differentiated w.r.t. rear end of the bike with other pulsars except its exhaust which is also similar to p180."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Very good bike.,5,"The bike is a looker, no doubt on that from my side. The quality of the plastic parts are also quite nice. They have lasted me for a long time, although I had changed the rear seat cowl about 5-6k Kms back as the screwing joints had broken and I had no other option but to fix it, as it had started rattling at certain speeds . Then I had a problem of the rubber bushes that was supposed to keep the side panels tight in their position falling off when ever I removed the side panels for regular cleaning of battery terminals and air filter.  Apart from that there wasn’t a problem I had faced with the fiber part."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Powerful Beast,3,"My Pulsar is two years old, its front headlight unit housing a projector lamp makes it stand out in the traffic. Side of the bike is muscular and the rear end is similar to other versions of Pulsar. Pulsar needed an all new design because everyone had got bored with its similar old look, the all new series of the bike is having totally different designing and looks, the bike is attracting a large crowd. If you are taking care of bike’s maintenance at regular intervals, you will have good time with your bike. Engine is very smooth and the monster generates a large amount of power. You can feel the sound of this beast while driving it at higher speeds. There is no bike available at such a low price with this much power. Its fuel economy is pretty good adding a positive point in its favour. I drive my bike daily, my average travelling is about 45 kilometers per day. I drive it fast but smooth, rough riding reduces the life of the bike."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Fast Indian,5,"It is the first bike of my life and I love it more than anything else in my life, however, my friends say this as I don’t give my bike to them. I bought this bike a few years ago, in school, my father gifted it to me on my 18th birthday, before that I used to ride Activa to school, which I hated the most as loved riding bikes. It was a great deal to me buy the fastest Indian as it was heavy and most powerful machine in the market as per my knowledge. I bought a Black Pulsar 220 Dtsi and it was like a dream come true to ride it to school everyday. "
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Catch me if you can,5,"I have recently bought Pulsar 220 as I had a budget of around Rs. 95k and I had options like Gixxer, Karizma, Avenger and Pulsar 220. I chose to put my money on Bajaj because it was offering the most powerful bike in my Bajaj with projector headlamps and disc brakes at both the ends. Fat tubeless tyre and an amazing semi-fairing made my day when I first saw it. Therefore, I cancelled all the other options and decided to stay on this brutal machine. The average of the machine is around 45kmph, if ridden properly and with so much power I can just cruise easily at 60kmph. "
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,About Pulsar 220 F ,5,"220 F  has a great power. Mine is new one, purchased on March 2011. It's pickup is super. Its super smooth engine makes you happy while riding it. Its power can pull the bike fastly in busy traffic. Fuel economy, they say(company) it gives 40 +, but I don't think so, its above 35 but not above 40 and If I am Talk About Look so In Grey color 220 F Was Looking Super,awesome. Really Thanks to Make a Pulsar 220 F Bajaj (Company)."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,A nice purchase for me,4,I purchased Bajaj Avenger 220 DTS-i on 06-Oct-2013 and have driven it 1500 Km by today. It has given me 50+ Km. per litre of mileage in realistic conditions. I commute daily from Faridabad to Gurgaon covering 80 Kms of distance. 
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,bahaj pulsar 220f dtsi,4,"When I planned to purchase a new bike, I shortlisted some best bikes available in the market. 1. Apache RTR 160 (Double Disk) 2. Pulsar DTS-i 150 3. Trigger 150 (Double Disk) 4. FZS V2.0. These all bikes are best in their class. I want to purchase a bike which should be good in city mileage, with great comfort and in a medium price range. After a long research I found that Pulsar is the only bike which can provide me these features in a good price range. So let's look about the features of Pulsar 150 DTS-i. Pros: 1. MILEAGE - When we plan to purchase a new bike our first priority is its mileage. There is no doubt about the Pulsar's mileage that, it provide 50 KMPL in city. 2. COMFORT - The sitting position of this bike too good and its suspension is also good as it work good on bad roads and off road. 3. HANDLING - Bajaj has improved the handling in this bike which make this bike in great control in market ride and good stability on high speed. 4. ENGINE- The new pulsar has a improved engine than the old one. The sound feels good. RATING:- Design and Style- 8/10 Instrument Console- 8.5/10 Engine & Performance- 8.5/10 Comfort while Riding- 9/10 Mileage- 9/10 Brakes and Suspension- 9/10 Ride and handling- 9/10 Price- 8/10"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,The Racer Beast,5,"This bike is my gf actually , i can't live without it !   It is so fast and furious too ,  i ride it without any hesitation cause it had never ever gave me a single scratch , the wheel base , the engine , spectially the brakes are awesome , no bike can beat this one , if you want attraction and trust then go get a pulsar 220 , this is what i alsways say to my freinds , i know most of you have seen it but nobody have ever felt it's power , i just love this bike , my world , my dream is with it. I am very thankful to bajaj for this bike and also want to wish best of luck to bajaj for more beyond doing on this , the service is yoo good and bajaj is one of the trustworthy company , so guys don't just ride , feel it with pulsar 220 ,if u haven't get any , then go get one . No one will beat you then , cause they can't"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Regular maintenance needed,3,"The bike is smooth in running but its gearbox is something that you have to maintain regularly. Gearbox problem costs me something at every service. On the other hand, its engine gives you so much of confidence on the road that you feel like you are riding a more superior vehicle. At a stretch, I have driven it for 380 kilometers, only problem I faced after the journey was sore shoulders, the soreness remained for a couple of days. Even after one and a half years of regular riding of my bike, the bike feels like new every time you climb on it for a ride. There are some areas of improvement like rear brake can be better for providing optimum safety and sudden stopping. It could have been given an all new rear view to offer an all new design to the 220cc monster. The rear view mirrors are also slightly tough to adjust. My name is Gautam Pandey and I will suggest you to buy this bike. Other than this, you can go for Pulsar 200 RS, NS and AS for all new looks."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Best bike with nice budget,5,"Here comes the brand new Pulsar 220f, having a 220cc engine with a roaring 21.04bhp power! The new p220f does not contain the fuel injection which has given a bhp more to that old p220. The torque generated by the engine is so impressive that you would just have a broad smile on your face while riding it.The bike can pull at 25-30 km/hr at the 5th gear very easily!This bike can hit the road at more than 144km/hr speed which makes us the fastest Indian! The p220f when compared to the karizma zmr and yamaha r15 in the section of styling.it lags behind like anything but still it has an aggressive look.It has got a very wide rear tyre which is not present in the r15.The p220 has got a 230mm disc in the rear and a 260mm disc in the front which makes the braking ability of the bike ""superb""!The bike is very comfortable in the city and the best thing about it is when on sitting behind you can feel the power of the bike.This bike can roll from 0-60 in 3.29sec! Now comes the very importat part of the fuel efficiency.this bike if driven carefull between 40-50km/hr .then gives average of 45-50kmpl and if driven recklessly then it would give about an average of 30-35kmpl at most but would not go under 30kmpl. This bike is a lot cheaper than the r15 and zmr.it costs around R.s.82, 000.The bike has got a very tiny rear view mirror from which looking behind to the traffic is almost impossibe! And also they vibrate like anything when hitting the road more than 120km/hr!The p220f has got the projector head lamps which is just superb!The bike is heavy in corners and when have passed the corner.is much stable.I took a test ride of about a 2km and felt that this bike contains all the features which we need in a bike. All over the best bike according to me with the price budget. Thank you. Regards , Rajkishore Mohapatra"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Road Ruler of the Year...!,5,"Bajaj has announced that is able to meet consumer’s demands despite no signs of the month-long strike at their Chakan plant cooling down. They have said that they had managed to reach the required targets until Monday (July 22). Bajaj manufactures the KTM, Pulsar and Avenger motorcycles at the Chakan plant.The 220 was launched in 2007 , This bike with its sporty looks and killer performance easily stole the limelight and redefined performance biking in India. But it came at a Price. So naturally, it wasn’t a commodity that every person could dream off. Nonetheless, It was and still is a wonderful machine, I know a few friends who still use this machine with over 90k clicks on the ODO and the machine is still healthy as a horse, which easily destroys the Taboo, that the pulsar engine lasts only for a maximum of 2 years and nothing above 25k kms. It’s true, there is a taboo that the pulsars don’t last much long.Now I got my Bike on March 2010. The parts that attracted me the most, the looks(I was a sucker for the twin projector headlights, the LED console), the touring friendly ergonomics, the power and torque and then the killer price tag. All in all it was the perfect vehicle, Complete Value for Money product and it was still a rare machine in my locality, all the more reason to opt for this bike."

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,THE KING OF BIKES!!!!,5,"Having one of the most powerful engine of its class offers great riding comfort and giving highest output. Pulsar was my 2nd bike and I have always been a fan of pulsar for its racing throttle and the ground clearance to speed pick up. Most efficient bike because of the combustion of fuel and air mixture, it offers some great startability and better torque. It comes at a price of Rs.88382. This new generation pulsar has a lot within it to be loved. It comes in with a sleek and sporty design, offers great riding comfort even for the person sitting behind.  It has set up a hard task for other manufacturers with its design language having a wolf-eye headlamps, modern looking fairings and wider tubeless tyres. Its just so awesome that one cant resist to have it. Pulsar 220 is worth a buy within the range of a lakh.  If you don't take medicine when you are unwell then you will suffer and the same goes for the bike, whenever its needed do the needful and then I'm pretty sure you wont have any problems in the longer run.

I dont always speed up for the 150kmph tag line but my more normal speeds are in between 80-100kmph. I also take my bikes feed back into consideration when I want to speed up as you all know, Pulsars are very intuitive.

The battery is really impressive till now I have never faced any problem to start the bike, just one press of button and engine is roaring. In rain I faced the problem of start, my bike was not starting at signal. There was no kick and I was really in panic. I took the bike aside put it in netural and the bike started. Yes someting this happens specially in rains that you bike will not start in gears else starting the bike is just fun. I live Up where there is bumper to bumper traffic and bikes handling is gud. Just it takes littler larger space for U-turn. It does not require much of maintenance, just because of my riding style I need to change the OIL every 5000-7000 kms (i ride very rough and most of the time above 100 and long drives). I face problem of gear being hard when the engine OIL is OLD but just replacing the oil solves the problem. In the drive of 18000+ kms, only one my clutch plates were destroyed. I replaced it for 1600 Rs. And this was since my brother does lot of stunt with bike so there is lot of pressure on clutch and grear. Couple of times he has submerged the bike in muddy area putting immense pressure on engine to come out of it. But the engine never ditched him. This game was part of challenge. Breaks are really just excellent, I come to halt from 130 kms/hrs to 0 kms/hrs with in few seconds without skidding my bike. In my job there much travelling involved and I think this is the best of best bike for me."

New BS4 engine is more refined than the previous one and the engine feels much smoother after first service (used Motul engine oil and rightfully engine warranty is void because of this!). Power delivery is linear and for a moment you feel like it's a fuel injected bike. Breaking is sufficient enough to stop the bike confidently at 80kmph. Like any other bikes, vibration is very common but it does not make a bite to irk you. Overall a good package for 1.1lakh price with no compromise! "

I always like the journey. Even at high speeds, the bike feels quite stable on the road and has superb handling.

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Power supply is fair,4,"This engine, in contrast to the other Pulsars, is not overly harsh and has a decent level of refinement. Power supply is often fairly linear and predictable. There isn't any bottom-end power, though. In first gear, I stalled the bike a few times. You get the impression that you are pushing the Pulsar RS200 in second gear."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Best Bike,5,The proper combination of a sporty and naked bike. Good fuel efficiency. Speed is enough according to this segment. You can use it as a long ride bike and also city ride bike. Ground clearance is good for off-road.

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 Is An Aggressive Bike,4,"Let us agree that Bajaj Pulsar RS200 is an aggressive and muscular-looking sports bike that is capable of too low to mid-level of touring, as the RS200 still lacks that high-level performance. The Pulsar RS 200 has a unique set of styling and distinctive features, especially the front profile as it looks like a face and the pillion seat height is too much above the ground causing discomfort while driving. I think it was the purpose of Bajaj to overdo the design and make it look spectacular so that young audiences consider it based on looks."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Best Ever Bike,5,"The best bike ever with exceptional performance, more power, good pickup, impressive mileage, and an appealing design."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,The Bike Is Very Powerful,4,"The bike is very powerful and looks like a monster. I feel that the bike is truly awesome, and whenever you ride the bike, it grabs most people's attention."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Average looking Pulsar,4,"It is just one of the average-looking bikes with all the fiber plastic body around, which makes it look cheap and kills the feel of the Pulsar. The color of the bike fades on its own, a glitch in the gear can be felt, and sometimes I have to kick-start my bike and whatnot. I would not suggest anyone buy this bike."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Good Performance,4,"Good bike with excellent performance, it's all about performance within budget."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Awesome Performance,4,"The bike looks awesome on roads, and its aerodynamic fairing makes it more beautiful, If we talk about the power it gives non-ending power supply from the engine, no one can beat the beast in this segment."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Good Performance,4,"It has a sporty look with a sharp and edgy design that makes it stand out from other bikes. The bike has a top speed of 140 kmph and can go from 0 to 60 kmph in just 3.9 seconds. It also has a comfortable riding position and good handling capabilities. Overall, the Pulsar RS 200 is a great bike for those who want a powerful and stylish machine."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Best model of Bajaj Pulsar,4,"The best part is the price range as it was in the affordable line for me. It has the most dashing appearing look and I liked the extra body coverage on the fuel tank. Though I believe the white color is a bit of a turn-off. Apart from that gear shifting is very easy and smooth, and so is the engine performance. I would rate it four stars out of five."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Looks kept at minimum,5,"There was a lot of rumor going around regarding NS`60 being the average in quality and having an old instrument cluster but I find everything to be just fine. The fit and finish were good and looks were kept at a minimum. What matter are the mileage, and I got 40kmpl of mileage which is excellent."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Test drive of NS 160,4,"I took two test drives from different showrooms to differentiate whether the bike has some problems or the showroom people had some issues with the bike. But later to my surprise, it was the bike issue, the build-up quality and the overall fit and finish is too poor. So is the performance on-road I would not recommend anyone buy it."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Refined engine experience,5,"It runs on a 160.3cc single-cylinder engine capacity with an oil-cooled and four-valve head to give support. And it gives 17.3bhp with 14.6Nm torque, which is quite good so it all combines and gives a good refined engine experience. Overall I like the bike. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Not great fit and finish,3,It is quite similar to other sibling models and quite poor in terms of delivery. The paint smudges off and the fit and finish are not up to the mark. The price is also on the higher side even though it has nothing to offer to a customer. Being from a family of Pulsar is not going to make a cut for every bike.
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Once a legend always legend 220f,5,"Bajaj pulsar 220f the best bike in India. Speed, mileage, braking system outstanding, performance no one bike can beat this"

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Bajaj Pulsar 220 F Excellent Power,3,"It has a nice road grip, and excellent power. The bike is safest because we can control it in any situation, and very good look."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Value For Money,4,It's the best stylish bike ever as its single seat is comfortable and looks more attractive. The mileage is a bit low but it's really worth it. Its pickup is also good and it is a value for money.

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,must buy bike in this segment,5,Good bike in this price segment with best average and mileage and the pick is is also really good go for it if you want to buy the 200 cc bike and your budget is low then you can go with this bike and the service cost is also very cheaper because this bike belongs to the Bajaj.
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Bajaj Pulsar 220F is an excellent sports bike,5,"It combines comfort and speed for its riders. It has a very radical design and aesthetic as well as cutting-edge functionality. Front and rear disc brakes, a digital instrument panel, a clip-on handlebar, and supportive seats are all features of the Pulsar 220F. The suspension is strong, and the handling and ride quality is excellent."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,this bike is king of all bikes at this price ,5,Pulsar 220 is my first bike. I have chosen this bike for its best performance and great durability. It's been more than 6 years since I am riding this bike and have completed small and big road trips. I have never felt any problem while riding my bike only thing I can say bajaj the quality is not up to the mark but there is a solution for that we can keep our bike in the best condition and time-to-time services. In final I can say that it's worth the power and an amazing look at this price rest depends on how you ride it.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Eye Catching Athletic Styling,4,"It's been a thrilling trip since I recently became the happy owner of the Bajaj Pulsar RS200. The bike attracts attention on the road because of its athletic styling and the choice of three eye-catching colors. The 199.5-cc BS6 2.0 engine offers strong performance and incredible acceleration. The superb stopping ability of the disc brakes on the front and rear wheels increases safety. The 166 kg weight of the bike makes it seem sturdy and steady while being ridden. Long journeys may be taken without frequent replenishment because of the 13-liter fuel tank capacity. Although the Pulsar RS200's price of Rs. 1.72 Lakh may seem high, the excitement it provides makes it worth every cent."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Two test drive experiences,5,"I have not heard good remarks from my friends who took it for many tests drive. So I thought, I will be able to make a better judgment if I'm considering buying this. So I took two test drives, and I completely agree with my friends. It is not worth spending so much money as performance wise it is just an average bike."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Stunning Bike,4,"The Pulsar NS160's handling qualities are equally stunning as its engine performance which is quite exciting. The motorbike has a rapid turn-of-speed due to its perimeter frame and relatively stiff suspension adjustment. Given how easy it is to flick it about in traffic, it is very fun. Things are only made more fluid by the mild steering."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Strong Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4,"Bajaj Pulsar NS 160 is a daily commute sports bike with sharpy features and modern updates. So far, my experience has been good and satisfactory. The braking system is strong so is the pick-up. Even being a small cc engine capacity it delivers great performance. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Worth buying Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4,"Many factors can make anyone more inclined towards NS 160, such as the price is affordable, ABS, clear lens cleaner, AHO, and excellent mileage. So why anyone would not want to invest in classic and the most stylish bikes offered in the Pulsar segment. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Pulsar NS160's style is unquestionably outdated,5,"Bajaj Pulsar NS160 nonetheless looks athletic and young. Its low posture and aggressive design lines give it a streetfighter-like appearance. With a white frame and wheels, the bike's most recent version comes in new colour variations that seem considerably bolder and eye-catching."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Good Bike,4,"The driving experience is great good pick and mileage, and the best engine we can see in pulsar bikes in the segment."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Perfect Machine,4,"A smooth machine and built quality are very strong, perfect weight-to-power ratio. The best option for beginners who wants to follow their passion for riding"
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Ordinary Bike,4,"The quality of the Pulsar NS160 is ordinary. it is certainly not the greatest in its class. There are no uneven panel gaps and the plastic bodywork is of decent quality. However, Bajaj could have improved the paint job a little. On the frame of our test bike, we could see that the white paint was getting messy and smeared out. Additionally, several of the panels had already begun to rattle softly."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Overall Performance Is Good,5,The overall performance of this bike is good as compared to other bikes in that segment and the new look in the 160 variant is really best with beast performance. Dual channel Abs system and front side down suspension is the best combination with the new beast look. Compared to other bikes in that segment I think ns 160 is the best choice for all. Without question go for it and enjoy your best riding journey.
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,This Bike Is Really Good,5,This bike is really good. It's comfortable. good handling and setting. this bike is really good power. I am so happy.

Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,The NS160's ergonomics are cosy,5,"Its riding position exudes a feeling of dedication that makes it interesting. The bike's seat height is around 805mm, making it the highest in its sector. But even for shorter riders, mounting the bike shouldn't be an issue at all."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Very Comfortable,5,I found it very comfortable and very easy to ride. I was searching for good bikes under my budget and I did not find any better option than Bajaj Pulser NS160. Mileage is very budget-friendly.
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Good Bike,5,"The bike is good, and the power is the best. It's the best in the segment, and it's a crazy combination of power and mileage."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Subtle Changes In Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4,"The Bajaj has changed the way we used to look at Pulsar segment bikes as slowly older and small-engine bikes are going through a makeover change. And the new looks of Bajaj Pulsar NS 160 are quite distinctively appealing because the first colour in which I saw the NS 160 was white. Of course, Bajaj had to appear with NS 160. The good thing is that the small 160cc engine is priced so well and budget-friendly, that even I wanted to buy it. But I already own a different bike. And I wish Bajaj could have launched this muscular and stylish bike earlier."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Good Bike,4,"I have been riding for the past 3 years, and I am glad to share my experience with you. Bajaj has created a fully loaded and well-controlled machine that feels like a jet when I ride it. This bike makes me feel like a pilot."
Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Good Performance,4,"I purchased Bajaj Pulsar 125 in 2020, I was impressed by the design and the performance of the bike. I liked every feature of the bike but many people find it difficult to handle because of its heavy weight and sporty performance. After 2 years of heavy usage, it gives a mileage of 40-45 km, and pickup, and comfort is amazing. Talking about the aftersales service I'd say I haven't been to the mechanic except for routine servicing and in my area it costs approx ₹1500-2000 for servicing so it's not too much. If you're looking for a budget-friendly beast you can go for it blindly. But I'd recommend using this before buying if anyone (friends, family, neighbor) has it. Then you'll get the exact idea of whether it is suitable for you or not."
Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Good Bike,4,It is a good bike and its ride is very smooth and comfortable it is the best bike on this budget and its looks are very good.

The bike additionally has a snug seating role and desirable suspension, making it a cushy ride even on tough roads. The build fine is ideal, and the motorbike feels strong and well-built. Overall, it's an extremely good"
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Ride Quality Is Superb,4,"Bajaj Pulsar NS160 Even though the suspension is precisely the same, right down to the spring rates, the ride quality is still fairly nice but not quite as cushy as the NS200. Particularly when riding over the sharp edge of a pothole, the slight but noticeable hardness in the ride is felt towards the rear. However, we left the standard preload settings alone, and the NS160 weighs roughly 8 kg less than the NS200. When the preload has been properly set and the passenger boards, we believe the ride quality will increase."
Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Mid Range performance - Bajaj Pulsar 125,4,"The Pulsar 125 provides acceptable low and mid-range performance. It doesn't struggle anywhere in the rpm range for a 125. It pulls cleanly, handles inclines with ease, and if you take it out on the highway, it will easily reach 80-90kmph. The Pulsar 125 will not win any accolades for its ride or handling, but it is a simple bike to manage in the city. It's light and nimble, and it's simple to park. "

Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Good Bike For The Middle-Class Family,4,"It's a great bike in this price range, it is a really awesome bike for the middle-class family, it gives good mileage and the looks are also amazing. The maintenance cost is affordable."
Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Pulsar 125 Engine Is Quiet,4,"The Bajaj Pulsar 125's engine is quiet, sophisticated, and moderately powerful. Its qualities as a well-rounded commuter motorbike are considerably strengthened by its exceptional riding quality and impressive steadiness. The main drawback is that the design is far too generic and resembles the Pulsar 150 Neon. However, the Pulsar 125 may benefit from that tactic as it boasts comparable engaging performance and similar proportions to the larger Pulsar 150 but in a more fuel-efficient design."
Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Good Experience ,4,1. Buying experience is very good. 2. Riding experience is good but the gearbox is not smooth. When we shift to 2nd gear there is an annoying sound and so much neutral false 3. My bike is spilled seat disc variant and black-red color and it looks awesome 4. Maintenance of this bike is good but servicing experience is below average.
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Satisfactory Experience - NS200,4,"The NS200 is available from Bajaj in three colors grey, blue, and white which is my favourite all of which have a white frame and wheels. Now, both the paint quality and the body panels' fitting are excellent. Nowhere did it appear that there were any holes or incomplete work. Even the polymers themselves are of good grade. However, the switchgear's fit and feel might have been far better."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Bike performance and overall view.,3,"The bike mileage is pretty good compared to Duke as well as its looks are amazing, simple, and decent which helps boys to convince their parents apart from that the clutch of NS is super smooth which helps riders to control easily, if I talk about performance and overall view so at this price it is the best sport bike to purchase."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Expected some changes -Pulsar NS 200,3,"I did expect some minor if not major changes in NS 200 but the new Pulsar NS 200 came with the same design. It might attract some but not going to influence a lot of people as people like me were expecting changes. Although, its maintenance cost and price are factors worth considering."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Need Improvements - Pulsar NS 200,4,"My friend has an older version of NS 200, and to see the difference in the new facelifted version we booked a test drive. The bike is somewhat the same in design and style, but the handling has been improved as all the buttons are quite handy and grabby. But it still has that same vibration feeling, so nothing much has changed. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Modified is Good,5,"The Bajaj Pulsar NS200 has all the modifications required. The 2021 version, however, shares the same appearance as the earlier design. And it still seems enticing to me. It has the unique split tail lamp that is synonymous with the Pulsar series, a striking headlamp with two pilot lamps, and a muscular fuel tank with noticeable lines and creases."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Pulsar NS 200 - good color options,5,"I eagerly awaited for Bajaj Pulsar NS 200 update in expectation of sharp and innovative features, and I was thrilled at the striking colour options that were provided. Additionally, the fit and finishing of the work are excellent, and the bodywork is of high quality. In this price range, it's  really a fantastic bike, and I'm glad and satisfied with my choice."

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Bajaj Pulsar NS 200 is a nice bike,5,"No matter if it receives an update or not, Bajaj Pulsar NS 200 has long carried the name as a very nice bike.

Everybody will get confused either it is a 125cc bike or 150cc pulsar. If someone changes the 125cc sticker with a 150cc sticker, nobody will be able to differentiate between them.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Mileage problem ,3,"Mileage is a bit problematic for me. The sound is brilliant and at a low price, getting a 200 CC bike."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Good on Highways,1,"The bike lacks initial pickup in 1st gear. The 1-2 gears are horrible to ride. We simply can't ride it on 1 to 3 gears as the bike vibrates too much and we feel uncomfortable. It has a fair amount of pickup in the 3-4 gears. Again in 5-6 gears, its power delivery is linear and gradually when it goes past 90kmph, it starts to pick up and then it runs amazingly fast and reaches 130kmph easily. The problem is when we drive in the city. I ride only in the city and I find it really difficult as the bike needs constant gear changes. Also, the bike gives new problems after every 2000-3000kms. It's difficult to maintain the bike for busy people who have no time to look after the bike."

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,The best naked bike ,4,"To all those out here fond of riding and enjoying their rides, i only have a review that is actually how I felt having this bike as my first bike.  Frankly speaking, I enjoyed the bike at it's lowermost and the highest rpm on the bike it's A pleasure that Bajaj introduced it again after discontinuing it. If I talk about the buying experience it was a great day that I totally choose the bike according to my rigorous riding altitude but as far as it is concerned when I purchased my bike for all others, my family member's it was a bike but for me it was like that i bought my dream of riding a bike. I always wanted to have a bike so I felt glad that now I can ride enjoy each moment and understand what pure riding adrenaline is. Secondly, if I talk about the riding experience the bike is a gem and a masterpiece in itself happy to have it. Riding is smooth and there is no loss of confidence when hitting corners but ensure that you have good tires. Which is the most important part?   Mileage: usually don’t keep too much track of the mileage. But I have observed that it varies from 30 to 35 kmpl. here are no issues in riding comfortably for rider except the pillion. If you take long rides just ensure that you will have to take several halts as the pillion behind you won't be comfortable for long. Taking you towards the details and performance the bike as my title says it justifies the title for sure. Most of you must be aware of the fact that the bike ns 200 was designed by edger heinrich. There is nothing that people don't know about ns 200 it is like the looks or the design helps the high-speed aerodynamics cutting edge technology that helps bike flow like water. But you will feel wind blast after a certain limit of speed which is not appropriate according to me as it would lead to certain problems. Like issues in high-speed handling. Performance is the best part ns 200 is remembered for its top end and how the bike performs on the track. The bike can be a good option for all thinking to get performance and average and thus keeping the maintenance in mind.There is no high cost that could affect your pocket but yes if you opt for engine oils like motul fully synthetic a little increase would be there in the cost.Pros fo the bike is that it can go anywhere you want and never feels like the bike is stressed. More importantly, the bike is maneuverable easy to handle and enjoy a safe ride. Now let's talk about the con""s of the bike there is a little vibration on the handlebar. Which is not good for such a legend.Hope that Bajaj is reading this. Probably this is the cons I came to know about the bike. It is like Bajaj can make this legend furthermore great by launching it in upper-class engine segment. "

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Value for Money ,5,I have purchased recently ABS model and I drove it & gave 55km
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Very Comfortable Bike,5,Awesome & comfortable bike. I drive like a devil move like a legend. Maintenance costs also in very low. NS200 highway cruising is better than city commute as the engine heats up in city and vibrations come over 120kmph & so suspensions are stiff so have to take care of the bumps rest all is fine seating isn't too committed will require some getting used to with the rear set footrest but it doesn't hurt the ankle. If it is discomforting for you then see for the apache it is more upright than ns200. 
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Excellence ,5,Its very good condition and better than Duke bike best of the price.
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Reviw of Pulsar 200Ns after 50K Km driven,5,The best performer in the segment if you are thinking about a rough tough bike with superior control than there is no competition with Pulsar 200NS in the same budget. you never feel any lag and you will always enjoy overtakes. I purchased this machine in 2012 after 6 years of use I had driven almost 50K km. But after the 50K Km driven the maintenance cost of this vehicle is similar to a small hatchback car. And due to the liquid colling system i get a avg. milage around 35 Km/Lit. which is fair with the 200CC engine.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,This Bike is for Fun &amp; Adventure,5,"I have owned the first generation NS200 and also have experienced the fun factor of the latest one. It was and it is always the best in the segment. It was a revolutionary motorcycle when it was initially launched back in 2012. Let's us see the fund fact of mighty NS. Though it was developed on the KTM Duke 200 platform, it has created it's own kingdom and legacy. Till 2012, youngsters in India doesn't have a better any best option to explore and show their full potential to do stunts. It has given wings to fly and the freedom to explore. Coming to design, with robotic headlight, bigger tank, 3 piece handle, perimeter frame and other elements gave it a fresh look and made it better to handle. NS has taken advantage of the perimeter frame, which helps you to carry more speed in corners. The 200CC engine kicks out 23 HP of peak power at 9.5K RMP and 18 N.M at 8K RPM. I feel it quick in low and mid-range and bit leaner at higher RPM. The liquid cooling system helps the engine not to heat quickly and to cool down from high temperature quickly, which gives the rider a long range if riding distance without stopping. The triple spark technology gives it a very good fuel economy, engine life and better response. But the saddest part is the vibes at higher RPM, they are miserable but overall it's fun to ride. I feel Bajaj would have done a better job in terms of build quality, which it has done in the latest version but not up to the mark. It is the best in class, Bajaj could have upgraded this with USD suspension set up at the front, DOHC set up and other quality-driven elements rather than doing cosmetic changes, of course, the new body graphics, belly pan added more beauty to it. The breaking set in the first generation NS200 was bit poor which has been improved and upgraded with ABS in the latest version. In terms of handling the bike, it's fun to ride on highways as well as the close corners of roads. Tyres are doing a decent job, but if want has more fun you can upgrade to some better ones. Bajaj has always given a promised fuel economy across all its Pulsar lineup (even all the bikes from Bajaj), so as the NS. In the initial days there no experts at the service centres, so have to struggle with my NS even for minor problems, but now Bajaj is good. it is one of the best options that you can consider in its segment, the latest version is more reliable and more value for money. "
