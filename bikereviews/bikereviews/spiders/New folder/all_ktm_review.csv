KTM 200 Duke,4.4,The middle class boy's dream,5,"what do you understand by Bike? a machine? a median of fun? a companion? well everyone has a different meaning for themselves. mine was a ""Dream"". i still remember i went to bajaj showroom when i was a kid and i saw this funky orange bike with broad tyre and a digital meter, i was amazed. through i was kid i didn't knew much about bikes, engines and no one dreams small. i knew that i am here at the bajaj showroom to get my dad's discover 125 which was financed by my mom and offcourse the ktm looks expensive and here at the moment it became my childhood dream. so after many years of when i was in 11th class my friend kabir whom i recently met at a function let me rode his ktm, well at that moment i have already took the test ride from ktm but this was the first time when i checked the potential of baby duke. i decided that no matter what i have to do i want a ktm. i talked to my mom as she handles 80% of my house finances so i asked her that i want a bike , a ktm and as i expected my mom said no because we couldn't afford it but after so many days of my requests and sadness . my mom told me that now its your 12th if you clear the JEE mains with good marks i'll get you whatever bike you want. whatever and then the real journey began i worked hard been through tough times, cried, been depressed, been lonely, but cleared the jee mains. my mom didn't really expected this and here it was the moment i went to the showroom after 8 years of the day when i saw the bike for the first time, t was the time for me to take it home via finance and yes its been said that "" sabr ka fal meetha hota hai"" and thats what happended with me i got a special edition ktm duke which is green and kinda tribute to vaughin gittin jr, who is a drift racer. so i bought my bbike in year 2016 and yes it was special edition just from showroom meanwhile it got fifferent decals and the fun thing was that my bike was bs4 in 2016. yes really at that time people use to honk at me to turn off the light as it was not the rule that time and my bike didn't have a light on/off switch. so its been 2.5 years since i with my ""war machine"" yes it her name. done more than 25,000 km. travelled in rain, cold,freezing cold, storm, sandstorm, mountain ranges, swamps. comming to a proper review it had given me a highest mileage of 49 kmpl and least of 12 kmpl and the current number varies from 28-33 kmpl though it varies with individuals riding style. highest achieved speed 139 kmph as it has a torque limiter. the maintenance was less in the first year it was like 700 for a year and the second year it was 10,000-12,000rs a year. the thing i like the most about my bike is its acceleration and its heigh sitting posture, perfect for city traffic and rage. its a mad machine for stunts as well being a stunter myself i can say that from popping a wheelie in the middle of the road  to stoppies at the signal. it never let me down. you are confident around the corners you have a great low end and mid end. some of you may not believe this but i have even shown my tail light to a cbr 650f in a traffic race. don't race, dont be a squid. i always wear a helmet but sometimes you need to shut the show-offs. """" Rider apne ""karm"" se bano, bike se nahi.""""  so the downside of my ktm is sometimes it dont give mileage i complain about it secondly it could have more top speed but you could bargain it with the savage pick-up for a 200cc. though time is changing many people around me have a ktm and they dont respect it, they bought it because they can and they only bought it for getting girls behind the back read. ""RC"" for being more specific has already replaced R15 as ""laundi baaz"" bike and anyone has it and they ride it like maniacs without helmets and the common snake style riding. if you know what i mean. i want end this with respect your bike, respect what you have ! love what you like, not what others. be happy with your bike, buy a bike for yourself not for others or your girl friend, always wear a helmet, keep your bike updated, dont go harsh on throttle unless you have a emergency, open road or you are riding in sleep hours. make your bike your best friend and it will return all the love you give."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM Things,4,I just love riding on this bike. I just love its sound. Whenever i go for a long drive. And its even fast. I ride whole day and night.

KTM 200 Duke,4.4,"Fun to ride, Expensive",4,"I bought a ktm duke 200, black on 18th sept 2016 and since then i rode it almost everyday, at the time of buying there was no other bike in my mind that was such awesome (dominar wasn't launched back then), so finally bought it. Talking about the pros of the bike, acceleration is something in which still no bike beats me in the 200 cc segment but that is self explanatory coming to mileage it is a heavy drinker i.e for me my bike gives approx 25 and even worse in bangalore traffic, and if talked about the service, ktm provides Worst Service Experience one manufacturer can provide, when i was buying there were literally fewer options, but now i guess its a stupidity if one opts for ktm duke 200."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Duke 200 review,5,This is the best 200 cc bike in India.Its power and quality is the best you can find in any bike .The riding posture is also good and does not cause pain during Long rides.The only problem might be the lack of dual channel abs but as you gain control of the bike it’s not much of a problem.
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Best one in sports bikes.,5,The bike is perfect for college going boys. Even though it is having an old design it is still best and even more attractive than the new duke 250.Still more powerful than 250 cc bikes in Yamaha.If you want a premium sports bike you can choose Yamaha FZ25 which is even more cheaper.But if you need a faster bike you can choose between the PULSAR NS200 and KTM DUKE200

KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM 390 -  the beast ,4,"There isn’t much to give away the little Duke’s low price or Indian manufacture either. The inverted WP fork and single shock deliver good ride quality and keep the chassis well under control, even at trackdays. Pirelli Diablo Rosso II tires help in all respects."

KTM 200 Duke,4.4,"KTM Duke 200 Rocks, Facts Surprisingly Shocks..!!!",4,Good :	1) Stunning Looks 2) Mfg. Quality 3) Engine Performance 4) Ease in Handling
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,bike,4,"i like that bike very much.because it look very nice a and it is used for sports purpose and the bike have nice features and bike have nice engine and good conditions and both front and reh have disk brake and tyre are also very good and when ever we apply brake at any need the bike will stop there only .the use of very good the main disadvantages of that bike is the mileage.if the bike give more mileage means it is very good.Riding fast means you also need brakes to match. With a 4-pot radially mounted calliper biting on the generously proportioned 300mm diameter front disc, safe precise and powerful braking is right there when you need it."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Amazing Bike With ABS,3,KTM Duke 390 is one of the best bike at 2.5 lack price tag.dis bike has really wonderful engine pickup.the speed is 140_155 at normal petrol but at extra premium petrol its speed goes to 170 top speed.ABS work perfectly.The main disadvantage is average. its give 20_30 km per litre. So its attract limited people.and heating issue disappointing very much at this price tag.
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM DUKE 200,4,"The KTM Duke 200 is a light weight naked sports bike. Last year, I bought the KTM Duke 200. It is best in class and offers good mileage. Its light weight makes it easy to ride and handle as it is easily driven in any situation. The fuel tank is small. A slightly bigger fuel tank would have been appreciated. The pillion seat is not comfortable for short and long rides."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,The best bike i have ever seen,5,"The deed has finally been done, Bajaj has pulled the covers off the Duke 200 at last and let us have a go at it. For a motorcycle which was developed and built at Chakan, near Pune, it’s almost ironical that we get to see the Duke 200 last. And now that I’m done complaining about that, let’s move on to the bike itself. I can’t say I was pleasantly surprised to see how KTM the Duke looks in the flesh, I’m not just talking about the orange paint job, because like everyone else I’ve followed pictures on the web and even got to see one at the recent Tokyo Motor Show. The smashed in headlamp, the short seat, the high rear fender sitting on top of a monoshock, the upside down front forks and the tank decals – they all look fantastically aggressive."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Ktm Duke 125 Sports bike,3,The new upcoming and dynamic 
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,awesome,4,i just saw this 
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Racers DUKE,4,"The KTM Duke 200 is the first KTM to be sold in India by Bajaj . It gives 33 KM mileage ,it has stunnig Looks, Road grip is poor in KTM , Maintenance cost is slightly high, just amazing power with Maximum Power of 24.6 Bhp at 10000 rpm it will reach a Top Speed of 135 kmph and its Fuel tank capacity is 11 ltr . Looks wise its nice and the head light is been a atractive thing in the duke its breaking is nice but the back seat doesnt seems to be comfortable the back seatter always have problems while sitting there .Fuel efficiency is not so good but its easily chases pulsar 200ns. Sound of the bike is fantastic. I am a die heart fan of ktm.The strong point of this bike is its appealing looks, alloy wheels, sporty body works and its damn good stylish graphics. Its stunning looks, good breaking system and multi info display are the strong points of this bike.This bike is not good on Indian roads. Handle and control is not as per expectations, and  it heat up early n my legs starts burning."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,The Ultimate Bike !!!!,5,"Guys, If you are dreaming to buy your dream bike, then this would be the bike you would be looking for. It's cost is around 1.7L  & I'm pretty sure that it's not that affordable compared to other bikes. But I wanna tell you that this is an amazing bike you would have ever seen.It's  Light weight and easy to maneuver in city traffic. We can find High quality components fitted in the bike. It has Good brakes with linear operation. While any stuff has it's own con's such as Short gear ratio, Rear end looks quite ugly & small pillion seat which is not so comfortable. The bike has a riding posture that is upright with the foot pegs placed slightly towards the rear.  The Mileage is around 30 Kmpl which is pretty low. The Acceleration is top notch as compared to other bikes. But If you are looking for a bike which you can take it over anywhere, then it is this bike you are looking for. Final suggestion from my side is you can buy this bike for sure after seeing all the specs & comparing it with other bikes."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,bike,5,"The 390 Duke breathes life into values that have made motorcycling so amazing for decades. It combines maximum riding pleasure with optimum user value and is superior everywhere where really nimble handling counts. Light as a feather, powerful and packed with state-of-the-art technology, it guarantees undreamed of dynamic fun, whether you're in the urban jungle or a forest of bends. 390 Duke– nowhere you will find more motorcycle per euro."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,bike,5,"It rides even faster than it looks. The KTM 200 Duke is the only 200cc naked bike with real racing genes. High-tech components, such as the ultra-compact, water-cooled, single-cylinder, four-stroke engine developing 19 kW (26 hp), the compact three-chamber silencer, the ultralight tubular space frame, the state-of-the-art injection electronics, the 43 mm upside-down fork from WP Suspension and the elegant swingarm all combine to ensure maximum riding fun, powerful drive and dynamic cornering. The Duke is unbeatable with its sensational power-to-weight ratio coming from an ultra low dry weight of 129.5 kg."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Mind Blowing Bike,5,"This is the motorcycle that redefined the word 'motorcycling' in India. Never before, the Indian roads had felt Metzelers so often sailing over them. The upside down forks, ABS, reaching the 60 kmph mark in less than 2.7 seconds; and 100 under 5.6, an unbelievable but true top speed of over 170 kmph are some of the things that only rich could expect from their imported motorcycles."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Good one,3,"Ktm bike s awesome bike, but the service in Coimbatore India  is so dreadful Don buy ktm b ike in India Coimbatore,although you buy ktm bike Don even think about that service will make our bike good.they making the bike useless by their service Don buy ktm in Coimbatore Don buy ktm in Coimbatore pls Don buy ktm in CoimbatoreDuke steps ahead than any other bike .It rules the road.... i Love it....who are planning to get duke 200 just proceed dnt think of any other bike because any other bike can replace it for sure .. my top speed in duke 200 is 148.....its an very good street fighter bike just be the head in the road and be a hero ................it is very youthful and stylish bike in whatever i sawn. so don't miss the bike. "
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Grand look with no complaints,5,"The major thing of KTM their engines were mind blowing till date. Even there is no minor complaints on the model. Apt pickup and appearance is just admirable. Good bike to go for a long drive. For me it's giving 19km/ltr. Good bike to choose on going with Fz, Gixxer, Pulsar and all."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,good,5,"KTM 200 Duke is a naked motorcycle made by KTM available in Europe, Australia, Nepal, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Colombia, Mexico and Argentina.

KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Satisfies my thirst of speed,4,"I bought this bike as I was looking for a sports bike which could dominate the streets and was able to satisfy my thirst for speed. Thus, I decided to buy the KTM Duke 200. As evident, the bike is meticulously constructed which gives it a flawless naked feel. I personally love the look of the bike as so do most of my friends. The engine is revved at 200cc which provides great thrust and throttle to the bike. You can simply feel the power as soon as you turn on the keys. My only concern is the high fuel consumption of the bike which adds to the expenses of the rider. Other than that, I am pretty contented with my ride."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM reveals GHOST,5,"If you have never ridden a KTM before, chances are that you wouldn’t believe me when I say , the very definition of how much fun you can have with something between your legs is going to be shredded, I am sure people who have tasted the KTM are grinning right now,and re-living that first ride of theirs in their mind.The 390 Duke features an all-new heart with a Nikasil-coated cylinder with forged pistons and a new head crank-case, among some other new organs. This gives the single-cylinder, 373.2cc, liquid-cooled engine a healthy output of 43bhp @9500rpm and 35Nm @7500rpm, which further results in an impressive power-to-weight ratio of 296bhp per tonne. A real quick one, this."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Bike skits alot because of no abs ,1,Abs is must for duke 200 as its weight is also less. the tyre gets locked even at the speed of 20-30kmph . No ABS has made a risk to ride this bike above 70kmph.. Plz go for 390 duke rather than 200 ... Atleast ktm must have provided optional ABS for duke 200 but sadly only in india they dont have ..
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM Duke bike is waste only show bike not disturb good manufacturing not responsibility,1,This bike is only so bike not responsibility service centre my bike is 3000 km . Waste bike is Ktm company products bike not purchase this bike.

KTM 250 Duke,4.4,The beast in 250cc,4,I bought my Duke 250 on may 30th it is a bike which can be easily handled by a person who uses FZ Pulsar etc but Duke 200 is not like that.  Duke 250 shows its power only when u give full  throttle until that it is like a normal bike.  The power when u give full throttle is like flying and the cornering is very comfortable u will love to corner it. I have visited Munnar which has 200 km away from my place and there is full of hairpin turns and I love to ride there.  The looks of the bike are amazing  when I ride it kids look me with curiosity

Its quite a good bike if you like racing or the bike which are quite good at picking up speed 100+ km/h.  Just go for it. Not only it can give you satisfaction but its really very comfortable in handling at high speed giving you confidence to ride at 100+ km/h. As the brand name is quite famous outside India. If some one planning to go for international bike tour definitely check for this one. Reason is, this is a brand which will be available in almost any country you are trying to visits and its quite easy for you to get it repair and maintain it. "

KTM 250 Duke,4.4,My new soulmate,5,"Wonderful bike. Worth for money and it teaches you a lot about leaning and tipping into corners. Much better than the old Dukes (agreed to the torque and the raw power of the old Dukes is lacking) but that makes the new Duke more reliable engines and are more fun to ride. Overall, it is also perfect for a college student or daily commuter as it puts perfect style and the mileage needed for Indian buyers."

KTM 200 Duke,4.4,ITS ALL ABOUT DUKE 200 (Pocket Rocket),5,"So its all about Duke 200 my dream bike. This bike is literally a pocket rocket which means its looks small in size but huge in performance. This bike comes in a naked category means no fairing and no fairing means no useless weight that the reason it is called a lightweight fighter. The performance of the bike is excellent pick up is unbelievable, the exhaust sounds unique, ground clearance is OK, the width of both wheels is perfect. Now about comfort for the small ride, it feels like you are sitting on a smooth soft but if it comes to long ride it feels like hard stone. It has DRL light so no much issue of battery draining is light is super bright and led indicators also best it flashes even in direct sunlight means in day time also its tail light is also good only the things which I not like about Duke 200 are it gets heated in city mainly in traffic but that issue can be avoided and another one is, it is 200cc bike but then also the top speed is of 135 as compared to other 200 cc bike it is less. The average of the bike is not too good and not too bad but if you want happiness you have spent some money on petrol. In one word for me, DUKE means KING."
