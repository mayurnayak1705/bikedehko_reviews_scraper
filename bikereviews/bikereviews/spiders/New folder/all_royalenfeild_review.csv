Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,Nice Bike,5,"Since I am using the BS4 RE for 1 year I've observed quite a few changes in the BS6 Engine which are quite convenient compared to BS4 such as the smoothness of clutch, stand and the major improvement is the alloy wheels which reduces a lot of weight compared to the traditional spoke wheels I would suggest to BS4 users to change those traditional spoke rims to alloy as it is very light in weight, main point to mention is about the clutch it is very smooth and convenient to use in the traffic compared to BS4 which is a bit hard and irritating in heavy traffic. BS4 is carburettor based engine whereas BS6 is Direct fuel injection which improved the mileage and efficiency in burning fuel. The reserve for BS4 engine is 2 litres and 4 for BS6. Another improvement is the always-on light, In BS4 it is turned ON whenever the bike is in ignition mode irrespective of the kill switch, whereas in BS6 the light will be turned off when the kill switch is in off."

Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,The King’s ride,5,"I am riding bullet Electra since 2014. It has got reliability issues but it’s because of the poor service of RE. Like all other brands they are just into money-making and I also doubt about the knowledge and skills of their mechanics. The best solution is to look out for bullet specialists (yes these guys exist) in your neighborhood. These guys are literally doctors of the bullet. And if you ask them, they will also teach you basic troubleshooting and repair for your bull. I did my first servicing at an authorized service center and then I never visited them. It's not that I had a bad experience but I got a gut feeling that these guys are simply not competent to repair a bullet. Its also because they have loads and loads of customers. So obviously the quality of service goes down. So I took advice from a few elders who own an old bullet and I got a very good doctor for my bull. So my advice to those who are hating RE or their bike is to find a very good bullet specialist. "

Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,"Built Like a Gun, Goes Like a Bullet ! ",5,"It was my dream to own a bullet from my childhood. At last I bought a standard 350 1 years before. Since then I am a member of bullet club called Bullethood in sikar. We usually go for long rides. The bike is an absolute joy to ride. At speeds of 40 KMPH where the fibre bodied ones begin to rattle, the Bullet stays firm. Of course its no match to the racing bikes but none of those can match the pleasure you get from riding a Bullet. The other RE models look good too but none, absolutely none can match the vintage feel of the Standard 350. My bike is delivering very good power, comfort & feel of riding. I am pretty much satisfied with my bike. But still there are some drawbacks for the bike. They are : "
Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,A POWERFUL BIKE,4,"This is an awesome bike available at the price of 1,47,400. The bike is available in 3 colours. I bought the royal maroon option. The bike has self start facility but no digital speedometer or fuel gauge. The speedometer is analogue. The bike gives a mileage of around 33 kilometer per liter on a normal traffic road. The fuel tank capacity is about 12 litres (approx).Hence for long journeys there is no need for time to time fulfilling the tank. It is a 346 cc bike with a maximum power of 19 bhp. The bike has 5 gears and comes with front disc brake facility.  The bike is suited for healthy persons as the bike is about of 182 kg. The staff of the shop from where i have bought this vehicle told me such. The bike achieves a speed of 0 to 50 in 5 seconds.and  the vehicle has a speed of  130 kilometer per hour. The head light has halogen bulb type. The bike has a comfortable seat. The vehicle adds a flavour to your personality. I had a great experience with this bike. I was caught once by the police due to not wearing helmet and paid more then the usual fine due to this bike because the person bearing this is understood to be rich. The bike has boxes for keeping tools and bike's papers. If you are planning to buy this bike don't think much and buy it for the bike is awesome."

Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,Lovely Bike ,4,Great bike at its price. Especially the Royal Enfield brand name and it's sound is just fascinating. It lacks a petrol meter but does have a low petrol signal on it. Its long single seat is very comfortable and very good for family use. It has ABS plus disc brake at the front and drum in the back. My one is showing a great mileage of 45km/liter to 47km/liter in city conditions. Servicing cost is also not much. If you are thinking about it then just go for it. 
Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,An Amazing Bike,5,It is an amazing bike at this price range. The mileage is good with great power. 
Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,good economic bike,3,Everything about Royal Enfield Bullet 350 is good but the backside along with the number plate of these models is slightly bending either right or left.
Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,Let your senses decide.,4,"From my personal experience so far, here's what I think: · Performance of the bike does not depend just on the new unit constructed engine, but also on the usage. If ridden within acceptable limits, the bike will exhibit a higher than perceived fuel efficiency. I get raised eyebrows from people when they hear my bike runs at 40–42 kmpl.· Although the bike is sufficiently engineered to serve both everyday commute and long rides, it is still not a perfect machine. There may be minor sporadic issues like blown lighting bulbs(parking, speedo) , braking switches going kaput, clutch cable snapping and some more. So far, I have not experienced any serious breakdown, while on the road. Bottom line is, if the vehicle gets its due attention and servicing, chances are rather slim that one would face issues.· Like many RE bikes, it does not have tubeless tyres, which obviously means, that a puncture on the road will certainly cause some distress. But then, if you ride with the correct tyre pressure, you may not have to see that day.· As mentioned earlier, one can do long stretches on it, and it is quite comfortable. Credits to the spring seat for that. For the pillion rider though, I cannot say the same. The stock pillion seat and a lack of backrests, are to blame. In one of my rides along with a friend who rode pillion, after 9 hours of riding, he utterly refused to ride back in the same fashion and took the overnight bus instead. May be, RE should think about the pillion rider too, and include a better pillion seat and a decent backrest.· Though it lacks features like a tachometer, a fuel gauge, which some consider standard in today's bikes, I personally did not feel the need. Absence of a fuel gauge will require you to do some math, and also be aware of fuel amount left. I am not sure if a tachometer will help in anything else, other than giving a clue on when to switch gears. If you intend to own one, then you must ride it once, get the feel of it, and let your senses to decide."
