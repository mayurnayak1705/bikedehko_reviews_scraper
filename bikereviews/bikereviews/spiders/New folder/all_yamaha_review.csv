Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,All in all a power packed performer,4,"I am writing this review after using this bike for 2 months,on city roads, with a mileage of 1100kms.. till now I have not experienced any serious issue, the pick up is absolutely savage, the riding position is comfortable, overtaking looks like a cakewalk.. only add ons that the company can think about is the ABS and possibly a gear indicator on the display console. The headlights are decent enough, the looks are seriously attractive , they turn heads(i have a black colour bike).. overall it's totally worth every penny and arugaubly the best 250cc bike in this range. "
Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,The Demon.,5,"The seating position is awesome & the initial power is better than ns200, the Breaking is good. I think Abs is affordable. "
Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,Powerful street fighter with best in class ,5,"Powerful street fighter in segment of Rs. 1.50 lacks. No comparison with another 200 cc - 250 cc machines,that's why it is best in class. Excellent acceleration and also breaking system doing a good job. You extended your  love when its start and exhaust note is loud with lovely bass. Awesome Ride feeling in highway as well as in city traffic. In city traffic bike little bit hit up, but it's ok for the fz25. I never found any herder cons about this machine. Servicing cost are affordable and the most important is mileage, that approximately 35 to 38 kmph overall. "

Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,"Top End Speed low, Lack of 6th Gear.",3,"I did my bike's first service at 1050 km. After first service for few days engine was feeling  smooth but after some time it started to feel same as before. It starts vibration at 6000 rpm. My other concern is related to lack of 6th gear or ""top speed end"". If you ride this bike in city up-to 80-90km/hr than it feels ""OK"" but  If you ride on highway above 100km/h you feel like bike is struggling to get top end. So there should be 6th gear definitely. One of my good friend having Mahindra mojo(has 6th gear)  decided to ride along. Mojo was very smooth till 100km/h and higher in 5th gear but fz25 was struggling. No doubt Fz25 reaches 120+ km/hr but not that much smoothly. "

Yamaha R15S,4.6,Sporty-Agile-powerful.,4,"The riding position is aggressive, and if you don’t know how to ride such bikes, you will end up complaining about palm and back pains, I have taken this machine on 300 KM rides also, it wasn’t that bad, I mean that was okay, one can handle it. The engine is super refined, best you can get in 150CC segment, and above 7500 RPM when VVA kicks in, this machine goes brutal, the engine just roars. I have driven this machine for around 11000 KMs in total, even after driving it aggressively and shifting gears at redline, it gave me 37-40 KMPL, even after such aggressive driving, otherwise it can give around 45-48 KMPL. It’s easy to handle, and it is indeed a powerful machine. The slipper clutch is just amazing, it’s too easy to do rev-matching with this machine while downshifting, which I found tough with V2 and any other sports bike in this range. Things could be better ? - yes, first is Tyre, MRF zapper is not good enough, you don’t get enough confidence in rain or at higher speeds or while cornering due to loose Tyre. - I heard build quality is poor, but so far I haven’t faced such issues, it’s been a year and 11000KM! Things are just fine! - another point is, it’s weight, it’s light-weighted, so it’s agile, easy to control but at the same time that creates trouble at high speed, due to less weight, again you don’t feel much confident!"

Yamaha R15S,4.6,The best bike in its segment.,3,"Back in the day when the v2 was launched, I had no idea about it. But the bike made sure I knew all about it. The same could NOT be said about the v3. I was already hoping that Yamaha keeps everything intact in the v2 with minor upgrades trickling to it. I mean, the v2 was perfect. It would be really hard to top it. The benchmark will be very hard to beat. I was proven wrong when the Yamaha put out the v3. Like the v2 where it resembled the patriarch of the ‘R’ family, v3 ticks all the boxes in terms of carrying on the baton of heritage in terms of the looks. Especially the tail section. To the untrained eye, the tail from the R1 and the R15 would look the same. The front is, however, a different story. There are just too many panels for my taste. The LED headlamps look stupendous. And the fake RAM air intake does add to the aesthetic appeal."

Yamaha R15S,4.6,Super bike.,5,"Excellent pickup, smooth ride, high power, and a very good electronic system."
Yamaha R15S,4.6,This one is amazing!,4,"Oh, it does! I am not gushing about the bike, it just does! Taking cues from its elder siblings, the R1 and the R6, the bike looks sharp and warrants a second look when moving on the road. The arrow-head shaped air vent between the LED lamps up-front makes for an aggressive face along with the sleek headlamps. The fairing itself has been designed nicely and fits very well in the overall scheme of things even though it doesn't go all the way down and leaves the engine slightly exposed. View it in profile, the sculpted fuel tank along with the upswept exhaust gives the bike an edgy look. The good thing is that there is a sense of balance. The design is not overwhelming or busy but at the same time, it is not too simple either that the bike is lost in a sea of two-wheelers on the road. But there is a grouse here! The fit and finish on the bike could have been better. The windscreen on our test bike had already started rattling and then, there are those ugly weld points on the Deltabox frame along with not-so-good plastics on the switchgear. It is slightly surprising because Yamaha models are known to have immaculate fit and finish. To begin with, the bike gets twin-LED headlamps, an LED tail lamp, a fully digital and comprehensive instrumentation console, and an assist and slipper clutch. The R15 model, which is sold in South East Asia, gets upside-down forks along with ABS which the Indian-spec model skips, understandably because costs would go up by a fair bit! We wish Yamaha offered ABS on the new-gen R15, even if as an option because the kind of performance it delivers, ABS should have been standard actually. You also get a USB charger and an array of optional equipment such as a Daytona exhaust and Metzeler rear tyre, all for a cost, of course. But the Metzelers should have been offered on both wheels."
Yamaha R15S,4.6,Not Fair,4,"Everything is nice in the bike, the looks are very good. Mileage is not as good as per the expectation."

Yamaha R15S,4.6,Super stylish.,5,"Yamaha R15 3.0 launched in India at Rs. 1.25 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). The 2018 Yamaha YZF-R15 V3 Power comes from the new 155 cc, liquid-cooled engine that produces 19 bhp at 10,000 rpm and 15 Nm of peak torque at 8500 rpm, which comes paired to a 6-speed gearbox. The engine runs on a higher compression ratio (11.6:1) and now gets a lightweight forged aluminum piston. It also comes with variable valves actuation (VVA) that aids in providing torque at low rpm.

Initially, to get adapted to the bike you feel discomfort in knees, wrists, back soon but once your body adapts that maybe after 2 to 3K of ridding, you will enjoy riding due to it's committed racing posture. Even though top end speed is around 120 to 140 km/h you feel you are on racing mode a big bike kind of feel. Going in hilly terrain or s bends is a pleasure on R15, you can produce lean angles of 30 to 40 degrees with ease.. may you should install frame sliders before doing that. I don't think no other bike produced in India can challenge or come close to it in cornering. The refinement of the engine is amazing. The VVA kicks in on top rev helps you to get top speed from 100 to 140 with ease. The breaking is good. The only flip side for touring I find is it has SOHC piston which helps in quick acceleration to reach top speed, but to hold top speed you need to keep engine revving continuously you cant relax the throttle. This is something good with DOHC piston in CBR 250R where engine revs are more constant with momentum provided by DOHC, where you can be a bit relaxed on highway trips. Apart from this R15 V3 is a brilliant bike from Yamaha with so many specs in that price range."

That’s the verdict right there for you in the first line for the first time ever on BikeAdvice. And why not? At a time when most manufacturers continue to plaster shiny decals on their old motorcycles and organize proper “launch events” for them, coming out with a motorcycle that is better in every aspect than its previous iterations is not a small feat, especially when the first two avatars have remained the benchmark in the segment for a decade now."

Yamaha R15S,4.6,YAMAHA YZF-R15 V3 REVIEW by SUNDER BARANGE,5,"The Yamaha YZF-R15 is a specific flavour of motorcycle. It's built to take you through a set of corners with supreme poise and confidence but at the same time it's adept at handling daily commutes and the occasional highway jaunt, given its agressive riding position, But what remains unchanged about the YZF-R15, is its effectiveness as a beginner motorcycle, especially for those who are serious about improving their riding skills. That makes the YZF-R15 a must buy this side of Rs 1.5 lakh."

The bike is a little heavier than the previous model but the looks make up for it. Usually my first choice would have been R15 earlier, but now with such fierce competition in market, I'd surely give a second thought."

Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,Best Bike ,5,"The FZ25 is my first bike and I did a lot of planning before buying the bike. I browsed for nearly every possible bike in its category before shortlisting the Fz25. The bikes I shortlisted were Fz25 and Apache RTR 200 4v. Also looked for MT15 but later dropped the idea because of that extremely small pillion seat and single-channel ABS. Apache was another good option but then again in the past, I had a quite poor experience with TVS so dropped that too. Some also suggested me Gixxer 250 but the fact that it was nearly 30k premium over the FZ25, also I didn't need that much power.  The Fz25 seemed to be a perfect fit for me. It has a nice punchy engine, more than adequate for daily commutes. The torque band is also quite wide and the bike also pulls quite neatly through traffic. Overtakes are such a breeze in this thing. For the first few hundred kilometers, I felt the engine is a bit buzzy but the eased off after the first service.  The gearbox is also slick. The need for 6th gear is obviously felt as the 5th gear also seems a power gear instead of being a cruising gear. I never felt the bike to be underpowered in my daily driving routine. I'm also not a fast rider, I prefer to ride the bike in a comfortable manner. The seating position is extremely comfortable and the suspension is also beautifully soft. It just glides over bumps and potholes... Said that I still feel the front is just too soft for hard cornering... The pillion seat is set a bit high but now that's because to give the rider a feel of sitting on the bike rather than on the bike...Overall I would say this is a bike for people who want a comfortable city carver and those who don't like being hustled around. And to be honest it looks pretty beautiful too. And it turns heads wherever it goes."
