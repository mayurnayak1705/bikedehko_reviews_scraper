Ducati Panigale V4,4.7,I'm definitely capable of just enjoying riding my bike these days,5,"The Ducati Panigale V4 - a manic, 211 bhp superbike packed with the performance to scare you silly, and electronic riders aids to make a hero out of you on a racetrack. We spent a day hustling this near MotoGP-spec Ducati superbike at the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. And we came back overwhelmed with the V4 engine's performance and the bike's overall handling. It is the most powerful road-legal homologated superbike in the world, and it's the first production Ducati to use a four-cylinder engine. After spending a few track sessions with the Ducati Panigale V4 S at the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia, we can say with conviction that Ducati has made a superbike which can make you feel like you have much better skills on a racetrack than what you actually have. Yes, the Panigale V4, or the Panigale V4 S, in this case, can make a hero out of you on a racetrack, as we found out."

Ducati Streetfighter V2,4.0,Amazing Performance Bike,3,"Having previously owned a Panigale 899 and a Panigale V2, I have a soft spot for the baby Panigale platform, and I've always found it to be an easier bike to ride hard and enjoy on the road than the V4. The Streetfighter V2 is based on the same engine, chassis, and technology platform as the Panigale V2, but it isn't the same, aside from the obvious changes to a naked machine. To be honest, I adore the Streetfighter V2's design. It's aggressive, bold, and everything I want in a naked bike, though to be honest, I'd like a little less plastic and a little more carbon for the price - and no, I don't want to add some wings. Although the cockpit is a little small, the dash is easy to use and the riding posture is extremely lovely and roomy, with those big, wide 'bars allowing a nice, upright riding stance. It's worth noting, though, that while it's spacious, the seat height is somewhat high if you're on the shorter side of the spectrum. Heating issues are there to accompany you in city traffic and now it's even worse. At last, the looks of this beauty are incomparable it's a pugnacious little machine and not to forget it's a crazy eye candy with its angry eyes."
Ducati XDiavel,4.5,My Experience,4,"In 2017, I purchased this bike, and it has been in my possession ever since.

Ducati Panigale V4,4.7,The Panigale V4 - Most Powerful,4,"The Panigale V4 is one of the most powerful track weapon and the road-legal performance motorcycle which can give goosebumps each and every gear shifts the way the bike handles and the adrenaline rush given by the 1103cc 90Â° Desmocideci Stradale V4 engine puts a tremendous 214hp(215.5hp in 2022 variant) at the peak of 15k redline, this Italian beauty is a hell of a beast. The engine is becoming smoother and better year after year and Ducati is trying to add more updated electronics and shedding weights for an even better bike this bike is just blown everyone's mind in 2018 EICMA shows after Desmosedici RR which is a long time ago they give a big bold v4 engine which is a huge appreciation for Ducati and a big step against the rivals. If you want to unleash the full potential of the bike just install the Akrapovic full system race exhaust and flash ECU then a couple of mods like carbon fibres, etc then you're good to go. And there are some negative points too like no fuel gauge, heating issues, no cruise control, and the big fact that it's expensive in every aspect including price, maintenance, parts, etc. If you want a really fun thrill bike to ride at weekends or on track or in street or on the highway I recommend the Panigale V4 to get because it has its own personal characteristics and at the end of the day you might know what I meant about the bike."
