Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX,4.6,Comfy riding position and good drive,4,"Kawasaki ninja 1000 is a very good looking bike,with aggressive styling that does justice to the ninja tag.The good looking twin headlights give it a better look.I used it for almost 2 years and then sold it to my friend.The bike gave a good average at first but it started gradually decreasing as every vehicle does.The bike had good seating.The rear brakes often got down and had to get thim fixed.But the look and seating more than made up for it."
Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX,4.6,Wonderful,4,"Kawasaki Ninja 300 was like a dream come true to me. The day I bought it, I become the centre of attraction every time I go on road. Initially, I found it pretty heavy to ride in traffic. But after spending some time with this power machine, I become familiar and now I can ride it like any other bike.It is a perfect practical performance bike which can be used for both touring and commuting and a good performer on the track. The engine is refined and vibration free. The gear shifts are more torquier and smooth which makes riding more comfortable. As you all know, it’s not built for higher fuel efficiency, but it provides more mileage than the old 250R. I have got an overall 26 km/l and it’s a good digit for a sports bike. The acceleration is very impressive. The only thing that makes a rider turn away is its price ta Though the seating position of bike is sporty but it is comfortable too. The best riding experience comes when you cross 6000RPM and it is best experience in the 300 class. I personally never found any problem in this bike."
Kawasaki Z900,3.8,Awesome Bike ,5,One of the best bike!! 
Kawasaki Z900,3.8,Great Bike,3,The bike is nice but the pillion seat is a little bit uncomfortable. The overall bike is nice and fun to ride a bike. We can take this bike as long as we want to cause this bike never gets tired.

Kawasaki Z650,4.0,This Is The Great Super Bike,4,"The most affordable naked sports Kawasaki with a 650cc parallel-twin liquid-cooled engine with great power (68bhp, 64nm torq). It has great performance and lightweight chassis improves the riding quality and handling, great overall performance and power. Nice fuel economy as compared to other superbikes (somewhere around 20.5kmpl). Can give up to 200km/h of speed without vibrations. However, maintenance cost is quite high and the availability of showrooms/service centers lacks. Overall, the best option in the superbikes category especially for college students."
Kawasaki Versys 650,4.0,This Bike Is Very Beautiful,5,Seeing this bike is very beautiful. The engine of this bike is good comfortable are good.
Kawasaki W800 Street,3.0,Wonderful Bike,3,The bike is inspired by the Jawa and the silencer engine. The refinement is good but the handling quality should be improved by the Kawasaki motors to run the bike in this segment. I own a Vulcan's that's the engine has been taken from the Z650 that's better than Harleys 750 ones. Kawasaki should have changed the style of the indicators that may high light the retro style motorbikes.
Kawasaki Versys 650,4.0, Best Package Indeed.,4,Kawasaki Versys has hight adjustable windscreen that does not require any tool.
Kawasaki Versys 650,4.0,Awesome Looks,4,"One of the best bike according to the looks. It's quicker than anything besides a helicopter and it helps you to learn the twists, turns and dead-ends of the city. I have discovered a number of shops, cafes and pubs that I would never have known existed if I only traveled by public transport. And nothing will beat putting your head down and bursting across one of London's bridges, bathed in spring sunshine, to brighten your Monday morning; however horrible your job is."
Kawasaki Versys 650,4.0,Highway Cruiser,3,"Owned Versys 650 2019 model and clocked 14,000 km on it before selling it in 2021. Versys 650 is a fuzz bike and is easy to maintain in long run. Extremely comfortable bike to ride on, did close to 1000 km in a day with zero fatigue and back pain thanks to the very upright seating position and wide seat. The windshield does a good job at highway cruising speed, 2019 model makes around 69 bhp which is adequate for Indian roads. You also got the Versys rider community ready to help you with anything life throws at you, made very good friends from the group."
Kawasaki KLX 110,3.0,Kawasaki KLX110 Great Bike For Beginners,3,"The Kawasaki KLX110 is a great bike, but it is great for beginners as this is lightweight easy to handle, and small engine, which is not much powerful. This bike is not road legal. It has a 112 cc engine which is enough for a beginner rider to start with. The engine has a 4-speed gearbox."
Kawasaki Vulcan S,4.7,Great motorcycle cruiser from kawasaki,5,"This bike has very good handling, ride quality is better than Harley 750 in any manner. the only possible issue is the seat which can hurt your butt on long routes ""however this can changed for very small amount"".Vibration level is also low in high gear at nominal speeds. The bike feels more like a sports bike at times with how the throttle responds. "
Kawasaki Vulcan S,4.7,"Great ""Sports Cruiser""",4,Great Sports Cruiser and a Head turner. It is surprisingly highly maneuverable compared to its size. One issue though is its low 130 mm Ground clearance which often creates issues around Speed bumps in Cities.
Kawasaki Vulcan S,4.7, Good For Riding,4,"The bike is too good on highway’s but the problem is ground clearance, for every road hump we must slow down."
Kawasaki Z900,3.8,Kawasaki Z900 Best Bike ,4,"This is very suitable for 5.5 and 6 above feet guys with long narrow dynamic vehicles, the bike with a 900cc inline 4 cylinder help u more power and torque. This bike is not equal to another. This is the most powerful bike please drive carefully. This bike gives mileage of 20kmpl on long rides and 18kmpl at traffic rides. This bike is the only option for superbikes under 10 lacs in India."
Kawasaki Z900,3.8,Overall Good Bike In Power And Comfortable Sitting,3,"Its looks, power, linear delivery and comfortable sitting are also good. The lower seating posture is a bit sporty. Almost upright seating can be toured and heavy if compared to others."
Kawasaki Vulcan S,4.7,Wolf in sheep's clothing ,5,"Very smooth to ride within and out side the city, negligible heating up in heavy traffic like the Harley's. Amazing pick up in any gear. Can easily be mistaken for a sports bike. Slick handling inspite of long wheelbase ."

The level of finish and quality on the H2 is some of the highest I’ve ever seen on a production road bike. Some won’t like the aggressive fuelling and power delivery in the first few gears, but then those people shouldn’t be considering a £22,000 supercharged sportsbike. If you want to chase lap times get a ZX-10R, but if you want one of the most exciting road bikes ever built, then step forward, and get in the queue."

The first time I drove it was a moment of pride for me as I had driven as h2. The time I drove the Hayabusa and the s1000rr I wasn't getting the feel of driving a superbike on the average speed.

Although, really, in one way the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R seems to exist for little else than to enable Jonathan Rea to win one WSBK championship after another (six so far), creating history as they go along together. In saying that, it may become sort of implicit that the ZX-10R is the best superbike in the world and has been for some time now, although that’s doing its mighty rivals a mightier disservice. Never mind the lengths to which manufacturers will go to blur the lines between pit lanes and showroom floors."

After 10 months piling miles on our green machine, we have a saddle-savvy appreciation for its superb reliability and versatility."

Kawasaki Ninja 650,4.5,Adequate power + good mileage for a tourer,4,"It could possibly be a good bike for the tourers, especially the ones traveling inter-city or interstate. The bike's comfortable riding position and ergonomic control give the biker the pleasure to be on it while mile-munching on the highways and the bike is equally good on the in-city roads as well. Mileage-wise, the bikes return a comparably better fuel average than similarly priced bikes. But one can also consider the Suzuki GSX S750 for just a tiny buck more. It not only has 2 more cylinders to power itself but it also sports 46PS and a 17Nm surplus of power and torque over the Ninja 650. So the Ninja here is an entry-level adventure tourer where as the S750 is a naked street sports bike that can also be used as a sports tourer but still the Ninja650 will return much better fuel mileage than S750 ever can. Make sure u know what u want before finalizing either of them."

Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX,4.6,Value for Money Sport Tourer,4,"Writing this review after clocking 14,000 km on my 2022 Ninja 1000SX. To start with, very comfortable bike for long-distance touring. It was a little intimidating in beginning due to its size and weight but as you ride the bike everything falls into place and gets your confidence. Seat height is comfortable for someone more than 5.8” tall and 235 kgs of weight is properly distributed, only will feel the weight while manoeuvring bikes in parking or at tight U-turns. The electronic package put this bike a true value-for-money machine but at the same time needs to be very careful with cables and sensors. The engine is silky smooth in whatever gear and speed you ride. Heat management is fine and manageable for such a large engine. "

Plus, it's relatively affordable to maintain compared to other 1000cc bikes. Despite its size, it's very comfortable and has great mileage. The power is smooth and easy to manage, with decent ground clearance that's perfect for riding in Gujarat. The adjustable rear mono shock is a lifesaver when traveling with a passenger, and the plush ride makes it perfect for long trips."
