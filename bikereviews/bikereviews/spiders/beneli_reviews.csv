Benelli TRK 502,4.2,Best Comfortable Bike,4,"Had a chance to ride this middle-weight machine. The very first thing that I noticed is the weight of the machine though it’s a 500 CV engine I felt heavy at the beginning but later on, I just got used to it and started to Love the stability on the highway because of the weight. The next thing I noticed is the build quality all the parts looked premium and worth every penny. People who are thinking why should I’ve to spend 5+ lakhs on a 500cc please do have a test ride on the bike. I had a chance to tour some 600-900 cc motorcycles this one managed to cope up with them. Now let’s see some of the flaws. This one is not for beginners, saying if you’re planning to upgrade it from your normal commuter bike that won’t be a better idea. "

I am a satisfied customer. "
Benelli Imperiale 400,4.2,My Wonderbike!,4,"I ride this bike for one year and for me it is the most lovely bike I have ever had. I am 61 years old and have been riding since my 18th birthday.
